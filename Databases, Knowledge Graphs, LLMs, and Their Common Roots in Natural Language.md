## 1 Abstract
> "Stepping back" is a common technique when new ideas threaten to overwhelm old thinking. The current excitement, and sometimes anxiety, around AI is akin to the kind of chaotic synergies that took place when electricity first came into common use. People fear for their jobs, make mistakes that cause injury, while at the same time marvel at the 'new magic'.
