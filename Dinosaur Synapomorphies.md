1. Temporal musculature extends anteriorly onto the skull roof
	> Mandibular [[adductors]] are the ones that close the lower jaw. In [[Dinosauria|dinosaurs]] they are very well developed, and extend forward (anteriorly) onto the top of the skull. We can infer this from the presence of smooth [[Fossa]] on the skull to which they attached. In close relatives it is restricted to the [[Parietal Bone]], and is expressed as a narrow depressio in front of the [[Supratemporal Fenestra]], whereas in [[Dinosauria|dinosaurs]] the [[Fossa]] extends forward onto the [[Frontal Bone]] and is much deeper. This all implies that dinosaurs had stronger bite forces than other [[Archosaurs]].
2. Posterior process of the jugal bifurcates to articulate with the quadratojugal
	> The [[Jugal Bone]] is the lateral 'cheek' region of the skull underneath the eye and articulates with the [[Quadratojugal Bone]]. Together, these two bones form the ventral margin of the [[Lateral Temporal Fenestra]]. In other [[Archosaurs]], the posterior process of the [[Jugal Bone]] tapers and meets the [[Quadratojugal Bone]] in a simple overlapping joint. In [[Dinosauria|dinosaurs]], the posterior process bifurcates into two prongs, which clasp the anterior process of the [[Quadratojugal Bone]]. Unclear exactly why this is helpful, but it may strengthen the joint and so be associated with the larger mandibular adductor muscles and hence higher bite force.
3. Epipophyses on the cervical vertebrae
   > [[Epipophyses]] are projections of bone, which range from small mounds to more elaborate flanges, the protrude from the dorsal surfaces of the [[Postzygapophyses]] of the cervical vertebrae. Various neck muscles would have attached to these, as well as some in the shoulder and back. Perhaps this indicates that these muscles were stronger in [[Dinosauria]]
4. Elongate deltopectoral crest
	>[[Deltopectoral Crest]] is a ridge of bone on the humerus that anchors the [[Deltoid Muscle]] of the shoulder and [[Pectoralis Muscle]] of the chest. Main purpose is to support the [[Pectoralis Muscle]], which brings the arm into the body. Although present in many animals, in [[Dinosauria]] it is particularly prominent, taking up betwen 30% - 40% of the length of the [[Humerus]]. This indicates that forelimb action, especially towards the body, was very powerful.
5. Open acetabulum in the pelvis
	> [[Acetabulum]] is the joint surface on the [[Pelvis]] which articulates with the [[Femur]]. In humans it's a ball-and-socket joint; 
	> a similar condition, although with a shallower socket and les spherical head, exists in most lizards and whatnot. In these animals, the socket is a discrete socket with a wall of bone.
	> In [[Dinosauria]], the wall is open - there is no medial wall
	> If you have a sprawling posture (e.g. lizards), then the [[Femur]] is pressing more into the core of the body -> you need bone there to stop it. Since dinosaurs have a more upright posture, the force is applied upward, so there is no need for bone in the back of the socket.
6. Fourth trochanter of the femus asymmetrical
   > Ridge on the posterior of the femur that anchors the [[Caudofemoralis Muscle]], which runs from th femur to the tail and pulls the leg back during locomotion
   > Most archosaurs have either a very subtle or symmetrical fourth trochanter. 
   > Asymmetrical in the sense that the distal portion is expanded compared to the medial one
   > Unclear what the advantage is
7. Articular facet for the fibula occupies less than 30% of the width of the astragalus
   > [[Astragalus]] and [[Calcaneum]] are the two proximal tarsal bones in [[Archosaurs]]. They form the primary articulation between the lower leg (tibia and fibula) and the foot.
   > In most crocodile-line archosaurs and lizard, the [[Astragalus]] and [[Calcaneum]] are essentially the same size. The primary motion in the ankle is between them. They rotate against each other and fit together like a peg and socket. This is generally known as a "rotary joint" or "[[Crurotarsal Joint]]".
   > In [[Dinosauria]], there is a modified condtion:
   > - [[Astragalus]] is much larger than the [[Calcaneum]]
   > - [[Astragalus]] is firmly braced against the [[Calcaneum]] and the[[Tibia]] and [[Fibula]], essentially forming a single complex with no motion between the 4 bones
   > - Ascending process: long, thin flange that extends upwards from the [[Calcaneum]] and braces against the anterior surface of the distal tibia, locking them together
   > - Primary line of motion is between the leg + proximate tarsals complex and the foot itself
   > - "Hinge joint" or [[Mesotarsal]] condition
   > - Futher unique condition in [[Dinosauria]]: the [[Fibula]] makes only a restricted contact with the [[Astragalus]], such that the smooth articular facet for the [[Fibula]] on the [[Astragalus]] is <30% of the width. The [[Fibula]] has been reduced, and the primary lower leg bone is the [[Tibia]].
   > - Probably related to the condition of upright movement
