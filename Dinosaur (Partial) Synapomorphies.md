The following traits are not quite [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]] of [[Dinosauria]], but they are traits that are found in dinosaurs and their extremely close relatives
1. Three or more [[Sacral Vertebrae]]
   > Articulate with the [[Pelvis]] 
   > Rigidly connect the vertebral column and the hindlimbs 
   > Most archosaurs have only two sacral vertebrae 
   > Dinosaurs have 3 - 6 
   > Reflective of the stronger artiulation between the backbone and pelvis, and would have helped brace the muscular hindlimbs of dinosaurs
2. Elongate pubis and enlarged [[Antitrochanter]]
   > Pubis is the most anterior of the bones of the pelvis
   > In dinosaurs (&c.), very elongate compared to the squatter form of other [[Archosauria]]
   > A major pelvic muscle, the [[Puboischiofemoralis]], originated along the [[Pubis]] and stretched onto the [[Ischium]] and the proximal part of the [[Femur]]
   > Longer [[Pubis]] would have resulted in a greater attachment area
   > Unclear what the advantages are - maybe something to do with the upright posture?
   > [[Antitrochanter]] is a rough articular surface where the greater [[Trochanter]] of the [[Femur]] makes contact
   > In most archosaurs it is quite limited, but in dinosaurs and basal relatives it is much larger
   > Unclear what the advantage would be
   > May have helped strengthen and rigidify the leg
   > May have restricted the motion to a single plane (important for fast-running animals)
   > 
3. Anterior [[Trochanter]] on the [[Femur]]
   > [[Puboischiofemoralis]] moves the hindlimbs forward and toward the body - attaches to the anterior surface of the [[Femur]], directly below where the head which articulates with the femur
   > Smooth in most [[Archosauria]], but in [[Dinosauria]] and their basal relatives it is expanded into a rugose flange called the [[Anterior Trochanter]].
   > Would have larger and more powerful hindlimbs, consistent with upright posture and rapid locomotion
4. Elongate, compact metatarsus with reduced lateral and medial digits
   > All bird-line archosaurs (dinosaurs, stem dinosaurs, and pterosaurs) have a condition where the metatarsals of the foot are elgonated and bunched together
   > Dinosaurs and close relatives have greatly reduced the size of digits 1 and 5 (ones on the ourside of the foot)
   > Means that the metatarsals basically act as a 'third bone' of the leg, along with the [[Femur]] and [[Tibia]]
