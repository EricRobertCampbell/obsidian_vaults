## Abstract

## Summary

They took a look at the ages for the Dry Island assemblage of [[Albertosaurus sarcophagus]], and either directly found or estimates the ages for the individuals therein. From there, they were able to construct a [[Life Table]] for [[Albertosaurus sarcophagus|A. sarcophagus]]. The finding was basically a very high mortality when young, very low mortality from 2 -- 14 (basically, sexual maturity), and increasing from there.

The hypothesis they put forward is that when they are young, they are vulnerable to predation, environmental effects, &c. Around 2, they reach the size of other predators in the ecosystem, meaning they face almost no predation pressure at that point. At sexual maturity, they start to fight with each other for mates and so are vulnerable to injury that way. Plus, as they get older they just start to deteriorate, leading to increased mortality.

They performed the same analysis on other tyrannosaurs (tyrannosaurids? tyrannosaurines?) and found basically the same pattern.

## Notes

- The sample is  [[Atritional sampling]], not [[Standing crop]] - possibly this means that the ones that died dropped out of the population -> what they have is not  snapshot of the population age distribution?
- They directly measured the age of some of the individuals (but not all) - the rest they estimated the age through a regression equation
- Created a [[Gompertz curve]] to model the survivorship
