## Summary

## Notes
- What is a reef?
	- Different people give different answers: mariner vs. ecologist vs. diver / fisher vs ...
- Common attribues:
	- built by in-situ organisms
	- rigid structure by skeletons and/or early cementation
	- high density of organisms
- We often think of tropical ones, but there are other ones:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230225200851.png]]
	- E.g. cold water or deep water reefs
	- Also built by stony corals and provide habitats for other species
	- Do not need light to survive
	- Structure: cold water reefs more form accretions
	- Distribution of reefs is generally due to the temperature of water, but can also be influenced by the nutrient content or aragonite supersaturation
		- how much calcium carbonate we have in the water
		- Most corals form calcareous skeletons
	- Shelf area: warm water reefs need shallow waters
	- Water currents influence the distribution as well
- Lots of organisms live there!

- The main organisms that build reefs today are corals
- Thoughout history, that is not always the case:
	- Algae, microbes, bivalves, sponges, [[Bryozoans]]

## Precambrian Reefs (> 540Ma)
- Reefs probably formed by photosynthetic cyanobacteria
- [[Stromatolites]]
- Still present today (e.g. Shark Bay, Australia)

## Early Paleozoic Reefs (540 - 443 Ma)
- [[Cambrian]]: most continents around the equators
- Cyanobacterial and sponge reefs
- [[Archeocyathid]] reefs (assumed to be some sort of sponge)
- Reefs could be up to 300km in width, >1000 km in length
- Could be spherical or other shapes
- Extinction at the end of the [[Cambrian]] led to a 40 million year decline in reef building
- Also characterized by a waming event nad elevated CO2 levels
- [[Ordovician]] - [[Bryozoans|bryozoan]] reefs
- [[Great Ordivician Biodiversification Event]] - shift from microbial to metazoan reefs (including corals)
- [[Stromatoporoid]] - skeleton of once-living organism, where [[Stromatolites]] are formed from bacteria
- Probably from sponges
- By the middle [[Ordovician]] we have more reefs and a more diverse set of reef builders
- [[Rugose Corals]] - went extinct at the end of the [[Permian]]
- Late [[Ordovician]] - [[Paleozoic]] fauna
- Variety of filter feeding organisms: [[Bryozoans]] and [[Brachiopoda]]
- Another extinction at the end of the [[Ordovician]]

## Mid-Paleozoic Reefs
- In the [[Silurian]], reefs were dominated by [[Corals]], [[Stromatoporoid]], &c.
- Many different reef dwellers over different reefs
- Continue into the [[Devonian]] (so lasted 80 million years)
- Warm time with high CO2
- More [[Coral]] and [[Stromatoporoid]] reefs into the middle [[Devonian]]
- [[Tabulate Corals]] become more common
- Another mass extinction at the end [[Devonian]]
- Very few reefs into the [[Carboniferous]]
- scattered sponge and micobial reefs
- [[Carboniferous]] started with [[Icehouse]] conditions
- Lack of large-scale reefs
- Dominated by calcified microbes, &c.
- Also [[Crinoids]]

## Late Paleozoic Reefs
- Characterized by
	- Abundant calcified algae
	- [[Brachiopoda]]
	- Large [[Foraminifera]]
	- [[Bryozoans]]
	- Some [[Coral]]s
 - [[Pelagic]]
 - Characterized by a large diversiy of organisms
 - Non-colonial organisms (e.g. [[Crinoids]], [[Brachiopoda]])
 - Huge extinction event at the end of the [[Permian]]
 - Basically eliminated all [[Coral]], [[Stromatoporoid]]s, and calcified algae
 - Dramatic warming and ocean acidification
 - Ocean anoxia

## [[Mesozoic]] Reefs
- Fluctuating CO2 levels
- [[Triassic]]:
	- [[Metazoan Reef Gap]]
	- Slow recovery
	- [[Bivalve]] reefs
- Biotic turnover in the middle [[Triassic]]
- [[Scleractinian Corals]] (stony corals) first appeared. These are the corals we have today
- Another extinction at the end of the [[Triassic]]
- Sudden decline in reef building
- Early [[Jurassic]] - lots of warming events -> few reefs
- Middle - Late [[Jurassic]] for them to diversify again
- Constructed in different water depts and different organisms
- [[Corals]] in the shallows, &c.
- Reef development hit highest levels in the late [[Jurassic]]
- During the transition to the [[Cretaceous]], another reef building organism became important: [[Rudists]]
- replaced [[Coral]]s and [[Stromatoporoid]]s in reefs
- Transition from [[Coral]]s -> [[Rudists]] was not associated with a mass extinction
- Ceased near the end of the [[Cretaceous]] (but before the [[K-Pg Extinction]])
- Another mass extinction at the end of the [[Cretaceous]]

## Cenozoic Reefs
- low diversity in the [[Paleocene]]
- [[Coral]]s declined due to the pulsed heating events
- [[Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum]]
- [[Eocene]] - possible symbiotic corals
- Lots of changes - temperature, ocean currents, &c
- Early to middle [[Miocene]]
- Major radiation in photosymbiotic [[Coral]]s
- [[Pliocene]] - another change in reef ecosystems
- [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]]
	- Due to the closure of the Straits of Giraltar, the Mediterranean sea dried up
	- Disappearance of the Mediterranean reef provinces
- Another event: Rise of the isthmus of panama (connection of North and South America)
- [[Pleistocene]] - resilient reefs able to adapt to changing conditions
- Carribean reefs: high calcification, fast-growing but not very diverse assemblages
- Present day: stony corals, &c.

## Questions

- Could the lack of algae in pre-cenozoic reefs be attributed to a bias against things without hard parts fossilizing?
	- Reef-building algae are mostly calcareous, so they fossilize pretty well
- how do you diagnose reefs in cold vs. warm water in the fossil records (catch-up vs. give-up reefs)
	- Cold water: sediment around the reefs are different - more mud and fine sediment. Also, the constellation of organisms you find can tell you as well
- Were [[Bryozoans]] ever major in marine reef ecosystems? If no, why not?
	- Yes, during the [[Carboniferous]] they were important, also in the [[Ordovician]]
- Symbiosis: modern coral have symbionts. Were other ones? Is there a way to tell?
	- Difficult to tell - depending on the fossil
	- Sometimes you can tell from the skeleton
	- Also, if something is only in shallow and warm regions they are probably symbiotic
- What can the history of reefs tell us about hwo modern ones will respond to climate change and how to help them?
	- How they might react - especially in terms of temperature ([[Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum]]).
	- Most difficult: need to find a climatic event similar to what happens today
	- Hard because most of the events happened over much larger time scales
	- Some studies focus on using the information about how they react (trait information) probably how they'll react in the future
	- Also for e.g. [[Foraminifera]]
		- Thin skeleton, so vulnerable to acidification
- Corals being produced and used to repopulate reefs. Is there evidence of that happening in the fossil record? Coming back to places where they've been wiped out?
	- More complex because the continents are also moving
	- They definitely vanish and then appear again
- Any evidence for deep sea reefs, now or in the past?
	- Yes - see the map already shown
- The organisms around black smokers - would that be considered a reef?
	- Not really -  the black smoker is not an organism itself. Depends on the exact definition you're using.
