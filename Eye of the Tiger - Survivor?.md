- Event data - what is the time to the event?
- [[Survival Analysis]]
- Incomplete data:
	- Censoring - generally you're trying to avoid the event! e.g. death, &c.
	- Right censored (the event doesn't happen) v. left censoring
	- "The proportion of observations that have reached teh ebent by the time t underestimates the tryue event rate by this time"
	- [[Parametric survival model]]
