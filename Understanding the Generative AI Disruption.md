## 1 Abstract
> We discuss why Generative AI represents one of humanity's greatest technological leaps and why it is displaying surprising "emergent behaviors" not previously expected of AI systems. We explore how prompting techniques and no-code tools can be used to make better use of Generative AI. Best practices in the use of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are based on findings from the emerging field of "machine psychology" in which researchers are trying to understand how AI systems based on Large Language Models think and behave.
