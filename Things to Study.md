# Things to Study

- [[Studying Paleontology|Paleontology]]
- [[Studying Data Science|Data Science]]
- [[Studying Software Development|Software / Software Development]]

Basic idea: on a rotating basis, every two weeks complete something (equivalent to one chapter of a textbook) about each of these things. Maybe also do a blog post on whatever was learnt?
