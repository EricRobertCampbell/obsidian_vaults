- [[Bone]] is a complex tissue containing
	- Hardened mineral ([[Hydroxyapatite]])
	- Fibrous connective tissue ([[Collagen]])
	- Living cells ([[Osteocytes]])
 - [[Hydroxyapatite]] is composed of [[Calcium]] and [[Phosphorus]], in contrast to the [[Calcium Carbonate]] hard parts of most invertebrates
 - [[Enamel]] (hard part of teeth) and [[Dentine]] (softer parts of teeth) are also formed mostly from [[Hydroxyapatite]]
	 - Difference is related to amount of [[Calcium Phosphate]] they contain
		 - [[Enamel]] has more [[Hydroxyapatite]] -> harder, less brittle, sharper cutting surface
		 - [[Dentine]] has less -> forms the softer inner core
- Two general types of bone in [[Vertebrata]]: [[Dermal Bone|dermal]] and [[Endochonal Bone|endochonal]]
- Most bone (in [[Vertebrata]]) are [[Endochonal Bone|endochonal]]
	- But most of the [[Skull]] is [[Dermal Bone|dermal]]
	- Others (like the [[Scapula]]) are a mix of [[Dermal Bone]] and [[Endochonal Bone]]
- Variety of bone textures
	- Can vary based on
		- Where in the bone it is located
		- How the bone grows
		- How it responds to loads and damage
	- Outer layer: [[Compact Bone]]
	- Interior: [[Cancellous Bone]]
	- Two additional textures based on speed of growth:
		- [[Woven Bone]] - rapid growth
		- [[Lamellar Bone]] - slower growth
## The Vertebrate Skeleton
- First vertebrates were [[Fish]]
- [[Tetrapoda|Tetrapods]] ventured onto land in the [[Devonian]]
	- Skeleton had to get more robust to support their weight (vs. being supported by water)
- All [[Tetrapoda]] share the same basic body plan
	- Head balanced on a discrete neck
	- Individual [[Vertebrae]] that together form the neck, backbone, and tail
	- Four limbs
		- Each supported by a bony girdle and having digits at the terminus
- Because they share a common ancestor and devlop the same way, the corresponding parts of the skeleton of [[Tetrapoda]] are *homologous* (constrast w/ *analogous*, where they have the same function and shape but evolved in different ways - e.g. te beaks of turtles and parrots)

## The Dinosaur Skeleton

### The Dinosaur Skull
- Over 20 different units
- Some [[Endochonal Bone]], some [[Dermal Bone]], some a mix, and some fused
- Can be divided into 5 complexes:
	- Upper Jaw and Cheek Region: Mostly [[Dermal Bone]]
	- Skull roof: Entirely [[Dermal Bone]]
	- Braincase: Mostly [[Endochonal Bone]]
	- Palate: Mostly [[Endochonal Bone]]
	- Lower Jaw: A mix
- Within each complex are bones, sometimes teeth, and important openings

#### Upper jaw and cheek region
- Two toothbearing bones: [[Maxilla]] and [[Premaxilla]]
- Sometimes the [[Premaxilla]] (and part of the [[Maxilla]]) are sheathed in a [[Keratin|keratinous]] beak
	- [[Ceratopsia]] take this to the extreme: they have a novel bone, the [[Rostral]], which caps the paired [[Premaxilla]]
- [[Premaxilla]] forms the anterior margin of the [[External Naris]]
- [[Antorbital Fenestra]]
- [[Lacrimal Bone]] forms the border of the eye socket
	- In some [[Dinosauria]], sports a conical crest at the top
- [[Jugal Bone]] - cheek bone
- Much of the posterior margin of the eye socket is the [[Postorbital Bone]]
	- Usu. T-shaped, but in [[Ceratopsia]] is modified into a brow horn
 - [[Postorbital Bone]] and [[Jugal Bone]] form the anterior margin of the lateral temporal fenestra (aka the [[Infratemporal Fenestra]])
	 - Posteroventral corner is formed by the [[Quadratojugal Bone]], and the posterodorsal corner is surrounded by the [[Squamosal Bone]]
- [[Quadratojugal Bone]] and [[Squamosal Bone]] make extensive contact with the [[Quadrate Bone]]

#### Skull roof
- Eight bones
- Most only visible from the dorsal view
- Usu. paired, and fuse together as the dinosaur grows
- Most anterior: [[Nasal Bone]] forms the majority of the snout
	- Defines much of the dorsal and posterior margins of the [[External Naris]]
- Make broad contact with the [[Frontal Bone|frontal bones]]
	- Wide skull table
	- Demarcate the dorsal border of the [[Orbit]]
	- Roof of much of the brain and olfactory tract
	- Anchor powerful jaw muscles
- In many dinosaurs: tiny bone, the [[Prefrontal Bone]], which sends a finger-like prong down to form the anterior margin of the [[Orbit]]
- Most posteriorly, the [[Parietal Bone]]
	- Overlie much of the brain
	- Additional protection ot th ebrain and sense organs
	- Anchors with jaw mucles
- Between the [[Parietal Bone]], [[Postorbital Bone]], and the [[Squamosal Bone]] lies the [[Supratemporal Fenestra]]
- [[Parietal Bone]] and [[Squamosal Bone]] are modified into the domes of the [[Pachycephalosaurs]] and the cranial frills of the [[Ceratopsia]]

#### Braincase
- More than 20 individual bones
- [[Endochonal Bone]], and so develop from [[Cartilege]] early in development
- Most of the bones eventually fuse
- Geometrically complex
- Identification can be extremely difficult
- Often pierced by [[Foramen]]
- Understanding can be crucial to understanding sensory capabilities and behaviour of dinosaurs
- Use of [[Computerized Tomography|CT]] scans

#### Palate
- Very poorly understood
- Within the [[Skull]] and above the teeth of the upper jaw
- Separate the oral cavity from the soft tissues of the antorbital and nasal sinuses
- Broad attachment sites for the jaw muscles that power mastication
- Position within the jaw and delicate nature -> not often preserved
- Use of [[Computerized Tomography|CT]] can help us understand them
- Six bones, 5 of which are paired
	- [[Vomer]] - unpaired element which forms a strut between the two [[Maxilla|maxillae]]
	- On either side of the [[Vomer]] are the [[Internal Choanae]]
		- Particularly large and elongate in [[Dinosauria]]
	- Posteriorly, the [[Vomer]] makes contact with the [[Palatine Bone|Palatine Bones]]
		- 3 or 4 processes that articulate with the [[Maxilla]] and [[Jugal Bone]] laterally and the [[Vomer]] and [[Pterygoid Bone]] medially
	- Defines the posterior margin of the [[Internal Choanae]]
	- Anterior margin of the [[Suborbital Fenestra]]
		- Locatd between the [[Palatine Bone]] and the [[Ectopterygoid Bone]]
	- Posterior edge of the [[Ectopterygoid Bone]] forms the forms the anterior corner of another opening, the [[Subtemporal Fenestra]]; essentially the floor of the [[Infratemporal Fenestra|lateral temporal fenestra]]
	- [[Ectopterygoid Bone]] and [[Palatine Bone]] articulate medially against the [[Pterygoid Bone]], a bone with a very complex 3D geometry due to many processes which articulate with bones of the palate and braincase
	- Two [[Pterygoid Bone]] meet on the midline, but diverge posteriorly to form the [[Interpterygoid Vacuity]] between them
	- Two remaining bones are [[Endochonal Bone]] and are the remnants of upper jaw in primitive [[Vertebrata]] 
	- [[Quadrate Bone]] - larger and more important. 
		- Much of the posterior region of the skull
		- Lateral to the braincase
		- Ventrally: has smooth condyles for articulation with the [[Articular Bone]]
		- Primary component of the jaw joint in [[Dinosauria]]
		- Dorsal head is a spherical structure that forms a rotary joint with the [[Squamosal Bone]], allowing a wide range of motion during feeding
		- Anteriorly, has a broad flange that articulates with the [[Pterygoid Bone]]
	- Other one is the [[Epipterygoid Bone]]
		- Small, triangular plate which lies against the lateral wall of the braincase
		- contributes to the articulation between these potions of the [[Skull]]
  
#### Lower Jaw
- Unlike the simple lower jaw of [[Mammalia]], in [[Dinosauria]] it is composed of a complex of bone
- Most [[Dermal Bone]]
- Some are visibly only laterally and others only medially
- Primary (and only tooth-bearing) is the [[Dentary Bone]]
- Left and right [[Dentary Bone|dentaries]] meet at a [[Symphysis]]
- In [[Ornithiscia]] (but not [[Saurischia]]), there is a [[Predentary Bone]] that caps the [[Dentary Bone|dentaries]]
- Posterior to those are the [[Surangular Bone]] on top of and [[Angular Bone]] on the bottom
	- Sites of jaw muscle attachments
- Between the [[Dentary Bone]], [[Surangular Bone]], and [[Angular Bone]] of most species is an opening in the jaws, the [[External Mandibular Fenestra]]
	- Hallmark of [[Archosauria]]
- Far posterior end of the jaws: [[Articular Bone]]
	- Sole [[Endochonal Bone|endochondal]] element of the jaw
	- Has a smooth, saddle-sahped articular surface to receive the condyle of the [[Quadrate Bone]] and thus form the joint between the upper and lower jaws
- On the medial surface of the lower jaw: deep fossa on the medial surfaces of the [[Dentary Bone]], [[Angular Bone]], and [[Surangular Bone]]
	- [[Adductor Fossa]]
	- Houses many of the muscles to close the jaws
- [[Adductor Fossa]] is actually a separate compartment - bounded medially by the [[Prearticular Bone]].
- Two additional [[Dermal Bone|dermal bones]] on the medial surface:
	- [[Splenial Bone]] is the largest and covers most of the medial surface of the [[Dentary Bone]]
	- Above that is a long, thin, bow-shaped bone, the [[Supradentary-Coronoid Complex]]
		- Formed from the fusion of the [[Supradentary Bone]] and the [[Coronoid Bone]]
		- Found in more primitive reptiles

#### Teeth
- In more primitive reptiles, teth arise from the upper and lower jaws, as well as the dermal bones of the palate
- In all but the most primitive dinosaurs, they only arise from the [[Premaxilla]], [[Maxilla]], and [[Dentary Bone]]
- Outer sheath of [[Enamel]] and an inner core of [[Dentine]]
- Replaced continuously thoughout the life of the animal
- [[Therapoda]] has simple, balde like teeth fro cutting through the flesh of their prey
	- Usu. thin in the mediolateral direction
	- Recurved at the tip
	- Serrations
	- Serrations are located on discrete [[carina|carinae]]
		- Sharp enamel ridges located at the front (mesial edge) and back (distan edge) of the teeth
	- Most have a distinct pattern of sculpturing
		- band-like wrinkles extend acorss the lateral and medial surface of the tooth from  [[carina]] to [[carina]]
		- Function is uncertain - maybe to strengthen the tooth?
- Herbivore teeth are much more complex
	- [[Sauropodomorph]] and [[Ornithiscia]] had complex, leaf-like teeth
	- Some basal [[Sauropodomorph]] had teeth more like iguanas which may have been suitable for a more omnivorous diet
	- Others, like [[Diplodocus]], had pencil-like teeth - maybe for cropping softer vegetation (ferns and shrubs)
- [[Ceratopsia]] and [[Ornithopoda]] had [[Enamel]] on one side of the tooth only with the other side covered only in softer [[Dentine]]
	- Natural wear would 'sharpen' the tooth into a knife-like surface
- Internal structure of the tooth [[Enamel]] was quite variable
	- May have a functional significance or may just be random inheritance

## The Dinosaur Axial Skeleton
- All parts apart from the [[Skull]] are the [[Postcranial Skeleton]]
- Two main parts:
	- [[Axial Skeleton]] - [[Vertebrae]] and [[Ribs]]
	- [[Appendicular Skeleton]] - girdles and limbs

#### Vertebrae
- Vertebral column is composed of individual [[Vertebrae]]
- Different names for the different kinds
- Two main parts: solid [[Centrum]] and and the [[Neural Arch]]
- [[Neural Canal]], which holds the spinal cord, passes between the [[Centrum]] and the [[Neural Arch]]
- Anterior and posterior surfaces contact the preceding and following vertebra
- Atriculations are strengthened by interlocking prongs of bone on the [[Neural Arch]] - the paried [[Prezygapophyses]] on the front of the [[Neural Arch]] clasp the [[Postzygapophyses]] at the posterior end of the preceding [[Vertebrae|vertebra]]
- Strength of the articulation and degree of interlocking determine how flexible the backbone is
- [[Neural Arch]] of [[Cervical Vertebrae]], [[Dorsal Vertebrae]], and the anterior [[Caudal Vertebrae]] have laterally-directed wing-like projections: the [[Transverse Processes]]
	- Thin flanges expand at the end to a rugose [[Diapophysis]] to accept one head of a rib
	- Other head usu. makes contact with a stalk-like swelling of th ecentrum - the [[Parapophyses]]
- [[Neural Arch]] is usually capped with a single, thin, midline flange called the [[Neural Spine]], which in some [[Dinosauria]] is expanded so that back can support a hump or sail
- [[Saurischia]] can be distinguished from [[Ornithiscia]] by several features of the vertebral column, esp. the [[Cervical Vertebrae]] and anterior [[Dorsal Vertebrae]]
	- Many of the processes of the [[Neural Arch]] and [[Centrum]] are linked to each other by bony struts called [[Laminae]]
	- Morphology is highly variable across species
	- Probably relate to an increased area for muscle attachment and the presence of pneumatic air sacs
	- Deep [[Fossa|Fossae]] and [[Foramina]]
		- "Pleurocoels" or "Pneumatic Foramina"
		- Pierce the lateral surface of the [[Centrum]] and lead to a complex network of inner chambers
		- Some indication that these are present in non-dinosaur [[Archosauria]], -> pneumaticity may be a primitive trait
- 9 - 10 [[Cervical Vertebrae]], although e.g. [[Sauropoda]] increased that number both by adding new vertebra and converting [[Dorsal Vertebrae]] to [[Cervical Vertebrae]]
- S-shaped neck enabled by parallelogram-shaped cervicals
	- Some, e.g. [[Stegosauria]] and [[Sauropoda]] straightened the neck
- Most [[Dinosauria]]: cervical [[Neural Arch|neural arches]] are small and the [[Zygapophyses]], [[Transverse Processes]], and [[Neural Spine]] are small
- [[Sauropoda]]:
	- Cervical [[Neural Arch]] are "extravagant in their complexity"
	- [[Zygapophyses]] are large
	- [[Neural Spine]] are often bifurcated
	- Array of [[Laminae]] make linkages between basically every different part of the arch
- Ancestrally: about 15 [[Dorsal Vertebrae]]
	- Some variation in more derived ones, but not too much
- Smooth change from [[Cervical Vertebrae]] to [[Dorsal Vertebrae]]:
	- [[Centrum]] becomes less elongate anteroposteriorly
	- Anterior and posterior faces lose their offset
	- Neural spines expand in height
	- [[Transverse Processes]] become stouter and swing outward to become fully lateral
	- [[Parapophyses]] migrate from the [[Centrum]] onto the [[Neural Arch]]
- [[Saurischia]]:
	- Often have a set of accessory articulations below the [[Zygapophyses]], the [[Hyposphene]] and [[Hypantrum]], to strengthen the union between adjacent vertebrae
	- [[Sauropoda]] retain elongate [[Centrum|centra]] and their [[Neural Arch]] is reduced to a maze of [[Laminae]]
	- Some [[Sauropoda]] and [[Therapoda]] have extremely elongate [[Neural Spine]], possibly for sails
- [[Dorsal Vertebrae]] of [[Stegosauria]] are immediately recognized by the extreme elongation of the [[Neural Arch]], which looks like a normal one has been pulled like taffy
- [[Sacral Vertebrae]] link the backbone to the [[Pelvis]]
	- Important for supporting body weight and strengthening the trunk region
	- Ancestor likely had 2 - 3 [[Sacral Vertebrae]], and most retain 3
	- Several group increased this number, usu. by adding [[Vertebrae]] from the [[Dorsal Vertebrae]] or [[Caudal Vertebrae]]
		- [[Stegosauria]], [[Ankylosauria]], [[Sauropoda]], [[Therapoda]], and primitive [[Ornithopoda]] have 4 - 7
		- Some [[Ceratopsia]]: 10
		- Some [[Hadrosauridae]]: 12
		- Unclear why so many are needed, but probably helped to stabilize the pelves and added rigidity to the backbone
	- Sometimes fused into a single large bone; other times they remain separate
	- Contact between the [[Sacral Vertebrae]] and the [[Pelvis]] is achieved by the [[Transverse Processes]] and their associated [[Sacral Ribs]], which are often fused together into a single mass
- [[Caudal Vertebrae]]
	- Ancestrally: about 50
	- Huge amounts of variability in size, shape, &c.
	- [[Therapoda]]: general trend to decrease the size of the tail
		- Most extreme in birds, where the fused remnants of the [[Caudal Vertebrae]] form the [[Pygostyle]]
	- Primitively quite flexible, but several groups evolved greater rigidity
		- [[Dromaeosauridae]] evolved elongate [[Prezygapophyses]] which extend as reinforcing rods along 10 - 12 adjoining [[Caudal Vertebrae]]
		- Many [[Ornithiscia]] ossified the [[Tendon|tendons]] along their tails, providing a functionally similar but anatomically distinct condition to that of the [[Dromaeosauridae]]
	- Some [[Sauropoda]] had longer and more flexible tails
		- e.g. [[Diplodocus]] and relatives had a greater number of [[Cervical Vertebrae]] than others
			- Most distal ones form a whip-like structure
	- Other [[Sauropoda]] and some [[Ornithiscia]] (e.g. [[Stegosauria]], [[Ankylosauria]]) modified the ends of their tails with spikes, armour, or clubs

#### Ribs
- One of the primary functions of the [[Vertebral Column]] is to support the [[Ribcage]]
- Rigid trellis to support the internal organs
- Most have [[Ribs]] emerging from the [[Cervical Vertebrae]], [[Dorsal Vertebrae]], and [[Sacral Vertebrae]]
	- Ones on the [[Sacral Vertebrae]] help form the articulation between the [[Pelvis]] and the [[Sacral Vertebrae]]
- [[Caudal Vertebrae]] rarely have ribs, but the proximal ones may have short ones in [[Sauropodomorph]] and [[Ornithiscia]]
- Most [[Ribs]] are composed of a proximal "head"
	- Two processes: [[Capitulum]] (articulate with the [[Parapophyses|parapophysis]]) and [[Tuberculum]] (articulate with the [[Diapophysis]])
- Distal to the head, most ribs taper to a thin point
- [[Cervical Ribs]] are smaller and more gracile than [[Dorsal Ribs]]
	- In [[Saurischia]] are extremely long, thin, and delicate - parallel the contours of the neck
- [[Dorsal Ribs]] are longer and more robust, and are outwardly convex to house the viscera
- In many [[Saurischia]] air sacs extend into the ribs -> the are hollow and pierced by pneumatic formamina
- Some derived [[Therapoda]] and some [[Ornithiscia]] - ribs develop a plate-like flange, the [[Uncinate Process]], which overlaps the adjacent rib
	- For an en echelon structure which overlaps like shingles on a roof
	- Adds rigidity
	- May be important to supporting trunk muscles and supporting the avian breathing apparatus

#### Chevrons
- Series of small bones that project downward to form the ventral surface of the tail
- [[Chevrons]] (or [[Haemal Arch|haemal arches]])
- Composed of fused left and right [[Laminae]]
- Together enclose a large opening, the [[Haemal Canal]]
	- Encloses various nerves and blood vessels which innervate the tail
- Lots of variation in size and shape among the different groups
- usu. absent in the distal portions
- In [[Dromaeosauridae]], are think and elongate, in the same sense as the [[Zygapophyses]], lending strength and rigidity to the tail

#### Gastralia
- "Belly Ribs"
- [[Gastralia]]
- Thin [[Dermal Bone]] along the ventral surface of the belly
- Presence or absence is perplexingly variable across extinct and extant [[Tetrapoda]]
	- Present in most [[Saurischia]] and living [[Crocodilia]]
	- Absent in most living [[Reptilia]] and have never been found in [[Ornithiscia]]
- Underlying order:
	- [[Gastral Cuirass]] is divided into discrete rows, each of which contains four rod-like bones
		- Two medial elements which contact each other on the midline (often overlapping)
		- Lateral elements which abut the ourside edge of each medial bone
		- Conjoined left and right medial elements usu. overlap with the medial elements of the two adjacent rows perteriorly and anteriorly
		- All individual [[Gastralia]] are connected to each other, permitting the [[Gastral Cuirass]] to act as a single unit
- In some, espec. [[Therapoda]], the [[Gastralia]] may have been the primary control on the size and shape of the trunk cavity and may have helped to power the [[Avian Respiratory System|avian-like respiratory system]]

## The Dinosaur Appendicular Skeleton
- [[Pectoral Girdle]] (shoulder) and [[Pelvic Girdle]] (hip) and the limbs associated with them
- Also the [[Clavicle]] and [[Sternum]], although they're rarely preserved
- Underlying geometry of the forelimb and hindlimb are identical:
	- One proximal bone, followed by two distal bones and capped with a series of [[Palmar Bones]] and [[Digits]]
- Form of the [[Pectoral Girdle]] and [[Pelvic Girdle]] are dramatically different

### Pectoral Girdle
- AKA Shoulder girdle
- Composed primarily of two bones: [[Scapula]] and [[Coracoid]]
	- Contributions from the [[Clavicle]] and [[Sternum]], when present
- [[Scapula]] and [[Coracoid]] are [[Endochonal Bone|endochonal]] and contribute to the joint for the [[Humerus]]
- [[Scapula]] is much larger and takes the form of a large, flat blade directly outside, and folling the contours of, the ribcage
- [[Coracoid]] is stouter, plate-like - usu. shaped like a semicircle or square, appressed to the [[Scapula]] anteriorly and ventrally
- Along the ventral surface where the two meet is the smooth, deeply recessed head of the [[Glenoid]]
	- Receives the head of the [[Humerus]]
- [[Sternum]] and [[Clavicle]] are both [[Dermal Bone|dermal]]
	- Critical components of the shoulder of living [[Aves|birds]]
	- Uncommon in [[Dinosauria]], but that probably reflects preservation bias rather than true absence
	- Some have been found with paired left and right [[Clavicle]], which is the normal [[Tetrapoda]] condition (incl. with humans)
	- [[Therapoda]] have a unique condition where the left and right [[Clavicle]] are fused to form a V-shaped [[Furcula]]
	- [[Sternum]] usu. a thin, plate-like element along the midline of the chest which is attached to the adjacent [[Dorsal Ribs]] by a series of cartilagenous extensions, the [[Sternal Ribs]]
	- Living [[Aves|birds]] have a distinctive large, robust, and keeled [[Sternum]] related to the mechanics of flight
		- Even the most bird-like [[Dinosauria]] lack this

### Forelimb
- [[Humerus]] proximally, then the [[Radius]] and [[Ulna]], followed by the [[Carpal Bones]] of the wrist, the [[Metacarpals]] of the palm of the hand, and the individual manual digits themselves
- [[Humerus]] is usu. the largest and most robust bone of the arm
	- Anchors muscles that control the majority of arm motion
- Meets the [[Radius]] and [[Ulna]] at the elbox joint
	- [[Ulna]] is usu. larger
		- Often has a pronounced [[Olecranon Process]] - process which extends beyond the elbox joint and serves as an attachment point for muscles which extend the arm outward
		- In derived [[Therapoda]] (and living [[Aves|birds]]), anchors large feathers whose attachment points are represented by small bumps (quill knobs)
- Articulation between the forelimb and hand is complex
	- Several [[Carpal Bones]], whose number and size vary
	- In lage quadrupedal dinosaurs (e.g. [[Sauropoda]], [[Ornithopoda]]) the [[Carpal Bones]] are large, strong, and blocky
	- In bipedal [[Dinosauria]] (where they don't support the weight of the dinosaur), they are often small and can be unossified
	- Derived [[Therapoda]] have a very flexible wrist and can move their hand in a wide arc, due to the pulley-like arrangement of wrist bones
		- Apogee in birds, where they can fold the entire hand (wind) against the body
- Hand ([[Manus]]) is composed of a set of [[Metacarpals]] and their corresponding digits
	- Digits are numbered I - V
		- I is the most medial ('thumb') and V the most lateral ('pinky')
	- Form of the [[Metacarpals]] and digits varies depending on quadruped or biped
		- Bipedal: mostly have gracile hands adapted to grasping
		- [[Therapoda]]: tendency to reduce digits in the hand
			- Basal species have 4 - 5
			- Most [[Therapoda]] have 3
			- [[Tyrannosauridae]] have 2
			- [[Alvarezsauridae]] have only 1!
		- Quadruped:
			- Larger and more robust hands
			- Terminal [[Phalanges]] sometimes modified into hooves
			- Individual [[Metacarpals]] and [[Phalanges]] are often shorter, heftier, and arranged in a tight arc
				- To support the body weight
			- Generally have longer forelimbs
				- Derived [[Therapoda]] exhibit a lengthening of the hand (e.g. [[Aves]] - large wings)

### Pelvic Girdle
- Three different bones: [[Ilium]], [[Ischium]], and [[Pubis]]
- Sometimes fuse with each other
- Relative size and shape are highly variable across species
- [[Ilium]]
	- Largest bone of the [[Pelvis]]
	- Located dorsally, above the [[Ischium]] and [[Pubis]]
	- Left and right [[Ilium|ilia]] are separated by the [[Sacral Vertebrae]], but sometimes meet dorsally
	- In most species: blade-like bone w/ two processes ventrally to articulate with the [[Pubis]] and [[Ischium]]
	- Most salient feature: ridge above the [[Acetabulum]]
		- Here the three bones come together to form a window-like socket for the [[Femur]]
		- [[Ilium]] reinforces this region by providing a tighter fit for the [[Femur]] and dissipating stress caused by locomotion
	- [[Pubis]] and [[Ischium]] are longer and more gracile than the [[Ilium]]
		- Generally resemble rods more than blades
	- [[Pubis]] is the anterior bone of the [[Pelvis]]
		- [[Saurischia]]: projects down and forwards
		- [[Ornithiscia]]: retroverted (projects down and backwards)
	- [[Pubis]] and [[Ischium]] have an expanded plate-like region proximally which articulates with the [[Ilium]]
		- These regions are the [[Obturator Plates]]
		- Pubic [[Obturator Plates]] has a long contact with that of the [[Ischium]] below it, helping to buttress the hip joint
		- Distally, the [[Pubis]] and [[Ischium]] taper into a long shaft
		- In some, most prominently large [[Therapoda]] like [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]], the distal end of one or both is expanded into a foot-like structure: the [[Pubic Boot]] or [[Ischial Boot]]
		- In [[Ornithiscia]] the [[Ischium]] and [[Pubis]] lay against each other
			- Also: novel flange, the [[Prepubis Process]], extends anteriorly form the [[Obturator Plates]] immediately in front of the [[Acetabulum]]

### Hindlimb
- [[Femur]], then [[Tibia]] and [[Fibula]], then an array of [[Tarsal Bones]] (incl. the [[Astragalus]] and [[Calcaneum]]), then [[Metatarsals]] and individual digits.
- Numbering of the digits is the same as for the [[Manus]]
- [[Femur]] is the largest and most robust
	- Although in some fast-running species the [[Tibia]] is longer
	- Discrete head that projects medially relative to the shaft
	- Capped by a ball-like articular surface which fits into the [[Acetabulum]]
	- Several [[Trochanter]] are located immediately distal to the head
	- Bowed anteriorly in fast [[Dinosauria]], but straight and columnar in larger species
	- Distally, joins the [[Tibia]] and [[Fibula]] at the knee joint
	- As far as we can tell, they did not have a kneecap bone ([[Patella]])
	- [[Tibia]] is much larger than the [[Fibula]], reaching an extreme in derived [[Therapoda]] and [[Aves|birds]] where the [[Fibula]] is a toothpick-like splint
- [[Tarsus]] of [[Dinosauria]] is composed of two different sets of bones
	- Large and more important [[Proximal Tarsals]] ([[Astragalus]] and [[Calcaneum]])
	- Smaller and more disc-like [[Distal Tarsals]] that cap the proximal surface of the [[Metatarsals]]
	- [[Astragalus]] is the most prominent bone in the [[Tarsus]]
		- Much larger than the [[Calcaneum]]
		- Forms the majority of the functional joint between the leg and foot
		- Tongue-like [[Ascending Process]] appressed to the anterior surface of the [[Tibia]]
	- [[Calcaneum]] is a small, crescent-shaped bone positioned laterally to the [[Astragalus]]
		- Primarily caps the distal end of the [[Fibula]]
	- [[Astragalus]], [[Calcaneum]] are firmly united to the [[Tibia]] and [[Fibula]], forming a single complex
	- Functional ankle joint is between this complex and the foot
		- second complex composed of the [[Distal Tarsals]], [[Metatarsals]], and digits
	- Size and morphology of the foot are highly variable
	- Relate to posture (biped vs. quadruped) and speed (fast vs. slow)

## Bizarre Structures
- Use the same definition as [[@padianEvolutionBizarreStructures2011]]
- [[Ceratopsia]] horns and frills:
	- Back of the skull is greatly enlarged
	- Composed of greatly enlarged [[Parietal Bone]] and [[Squamosal Bone]]
	- Peripheral edges are peppered with nubbins of [[Dermal Bone]], the [[Epioccipitals]]
	- True horns (bony core, keratinous sheath) are usually present on the snout ([[Nasal Bone]]) and above the eyes (on the [[Postorbital Bone]])
	- May have been used for social / sexual display ([[Social Selection]] or [[Sexual Selection]])
	- Most common explanation is defence
		- Lots of predators around at that time
		- [[Finite Element Analysis]] indicates that it's at least plausible
		- Experiments show that the horns, &c. are well-placed for jousting w/ others of the same species
		- [[Triceratops]] show increased pathologies on the bones where the horns of rivals would be expected to have been when 'locked together' during a joust
- [[Pachycephalosaurs]] skull domes
	- [[Frontal Bone]] and [[Parietal Bone]] are fused, thickened, ad vaulted into a dome
		- Some species incorporate other bones, e.g. the [[Postorbital Bone]] and [[Squamosal Bone]]
		- So solid that the [[Supratemporal Fenestra]] is closed
	- [[Analogy]] to big horned sheep, &c. suggests head butting
	- Early indications that the skull would be good for that
		- Questions: head-to-head or on the side of the animal?
	- More recent analysis by e.g. [[J. R. Horner]] showed that the bone structure wasn't good for ramming
		- But then even more analysis (including by [[Finite Element Analysis|FEA]]) showed that they were at least as suited for ramming as animals today which do it
		- Probably more work is needed here
- [[Hadrosauridae]] cranial crests
	- [[Dermal Bone]] of the face are modified into a crest
		- Small or solid in the [[Hadrosaurines]] (aka Saurolophines)
		- Complex and hollow in the [[Lambeosaurines]]
	- In [[Lambeosaurines]], composed mainly of the [[Premaxilla]] and [[Nasal Bone]]
	- Lots of hypotheses as to their purpose
	- Three most credible
		- Function in olfaction
			- Probably not
			- Much of the nasal cavity was was outside the crest -> no role in olefaction
			- [[Olfactory Bulb]] of the brain were miniscule -> smell was probably not important
		- Sound production
			- Modelling shows that it is reasonable
			- Ear could hear exactly those frequencies that the crest would have produced
		- Visual display
			- Probably also reasonable
- [[Scutes]] and [[Osteoderms]]
	- Three major groups had these: [[Ankylosauria]], [[Stegosauria]], and [[Sauropoda]]
	- [[Dermal Bone]] embedded in the skin: [[Osteoderms]]
	- In [[Ankylosauria]], most of the body is covered in these [[Osteoderms]]
		- Generally in multiple elongate rows
		- In some species they envelop the belly
		- [[Scutes]] on the back often develop into spines
		- Near the [[Pelvis]] they fuse into a broad apron, the [[Sacral Shield]]
	- Less elaborate in [[Stegosauria]] and [[Sauropoda]]
	- [[Stegosauria]]
		- Transformed the dorsal [[Osteoderms]] into a series of plates and spikes
		- Only a few retain them along their flanks
		- Some have a complex of small interlocking ossicles in the throat region, the [[Gular Shield]]
	- [[Sauropoda]]
		- Members of the [[Titanosauria]] had two different kinds:
			- Large ovoid plates
			- Smaller ossicles
				- Pack close together to cover the back and flank regions
		- Some evidence that some had keratinized spikes on their neck and back
	- [[Osteoderms]] in these groups were well-suited as armour (able to witstand lots of stress from different directions)
	- Tail clubs of [[Ankylosauria]] would be able to withstand the stress of hitting something
- [[Stegosauria]] Plates and Spikes
	- Two rows of plates / spikes down the back
	- Great variety of form, shape, number, and size
	- Most had triangular plates along the back, transitioning to more spike like toward the tail
	- Typified by [[Kentrosaurus]], which had 14 - 15 plates along each row along with a single spike on the shoulders
	- [[Huayangosarus]] was the only one that retained the flank [[Osteoderms]] of the other [[Thyreophorans]]
	- Most extreme modifications in [[Stegosaurus]]
	- Unclear what they were used for
		- Maybe defense, but that seems unlikely - unable to withstand the stress of biting from [[Allosaurus]], the dominant predator at the time
		- Lots of blood vessels -> [[Thermoregulation]]?
			- More research -> unlikely. Probably the blood vessels were mostly there to supply the keratinous sheath
			- Suggested that [[Species Recognition]] or display was more likely
		- Tail spike was probably used as a weapon
			- Able to withstand lots of stress
			- Trauma-related pathologies
			- Fossil of an [[Allosaurus]] with a hole matching the size / shape of the spike
