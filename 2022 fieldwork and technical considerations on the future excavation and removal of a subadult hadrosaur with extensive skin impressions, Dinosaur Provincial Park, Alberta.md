## Summary

## Abstract
```

```

## Notes
- 3 sections:
	- Tail with skin impressions
	- Distal end of the [[Ischium]]
		- Slightly expanded - probably a [[Lambeosaurines]]
		- (Those have an [[Ischial Boot]])
	- [[Metatarsals]] (with skin)
- Pretty sure they have the whole back end
- Death pose in [[Hadrosauridae]]:
	- Tail out
	- Neck in a swan pose
- Huge hill buries most of it
	- Lots of overburden
- High hill -> lots of technical (health and safety) challenges
- To protect the exposed sections of bone, create an overhanging "shield"
- Mudded the toilet paper w/ clay from nearby
- Removed 105.25 tonnes of overburden in 5.5 days
- Roughly where the head should be: huge crack :(
- Need to remove it in one section (since it's a mummy)
- Roughly: 3.5 - 5.25 tonnes
- No vehicles are allowed in the park, especially driving over the wild areas!
- No traditional tools - don't want to damage the skin!
- Helicopter or overland?
- Helicopter:
	- Good, but might be too heavy. Also some logistical challenges getting one that's large enough to move this over to Alberta
- Overland (truck)
	- Cheaper, but environmental concerns (for the environment of [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]])
	- Maybe do it in winter? Most of the animals are gone and the plant roots should be protected
	- Also it means that the road will e harder - fewer issues with getting stuck or whatever
- How to get it into the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology]] once it's out of the park?
	- Door aren't actually wide enough for it to fit!
	- Tilt it on its side? Doubtful...
