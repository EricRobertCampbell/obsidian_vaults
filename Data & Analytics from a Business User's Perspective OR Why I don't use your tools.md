## 1 Abstract
> I've been a data consumer starting in Excel and Tableau all the way up to running APIs, helping to design data architectures, data governance systems, and building data science models. In that time, I can count on my hand the number of tools from dedicated Data and Analytics teams that I've used on an on-going basis as most IT groups mistake the problem that business users are trying to solve. In my talk, I'll take the audience through the decision making process in business groups and how IT teams can best support them to build a long-term partnership.
