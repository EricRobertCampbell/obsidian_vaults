## #1 - Uncertainty about...
- Where to begin
- How to begin
- What to begin

## #2 - Too Costly
- Made a point - if you have a task that takes one hour and you reduce it to 5 minutes, you're really costing yourself $6,500 per year (given some assumption)
- Don't think of it as losing a job, but focus on the tasks that are interesting or more profitable for the brokerage
- Tip for brokerage: negotiate for a trial period to assess ROI
- Tip for brokerage: ask for references

## #3 - No Capacity / Time
- Recognize your capacity limits
- Plan your calendar around key dates
- Lean on your team - don't be a bottleneck
	- e.g. offload some of the work to a member of the team who is interested in leadership
## #4 - Apathetic Team
- What if your team simply doesn't care?
- Best to obtain early buy in by showcasing value added for them personally
- Producers: want easy to use technology, no fuss
- CSRs and Account Managers: Want to avoid duplicate entry
- Management and Others: Want effective reporting tools

## #5 - Imperfect Technology
- Over-promised
	- Focus on the technology that actually exists today - don't believe things that don't exist
	- Demo stuff is in a carefully controlled environment - may not reflect actual usage

	- Something to consider: how responsive is the company to updates / feedback? Can they show updates or changes that they've made in response to feedback?
- Buggier than expected
- Missing one key function
- Not user friendly

## Q & A

- Any other concerns?
	- Cybersecurity - pay attention to privacy and security
