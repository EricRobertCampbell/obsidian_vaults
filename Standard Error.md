Standard error of a statistics (usu. the estimation of a parameter) is the standard deviation of the [[Sampling Distribution]]

For the mean, the sampling distribution is generated by taking lots of measurements and taking the mean. As you take these samples, that will form a distribution with its own mean and variance. As you take more samples, the sample mean should converge to the distribution mean. $\text{SE}_\text{mean}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
