## Summary

## Abstract
```
Communities from the Late Cretaceous of North America are comprised a variety of dinosaurs including a wide array of greater than 1000 kg herbivores (megaherbivores) including the ‘horned’ ceratopsids and ‘duck-billed’ hadrosaurids. Previous research has indicated that so many large dinosaurs were able to coexist via resource partitioning wherein each group ate different plants from other groups. This research focused on interactions between adults and did not consider the influence smaller dinosaurs (small dinosaur species and juvenile megaherbivores) had on Late Cretaceous ecosystems. Here I will be presenting the work from my MSc research which focused on how diet may have changed as hadrosaurids and ceratopsids grew and how these juvenile forms interacted with similar-sized adults of smaller herbivores. Several changes observed in the skull suggest that these dinosaurs selectively fed on low-growing soft vegetation when they were young and gradually incorporated tougher, higher growing vegetation as they matured. Through time, the roles played by juvenile megaherbivores and leptoceratopsids shifted away from those of their ancestors in order to facilitate resource partitioning between these groups. Consideration of browse profiles for the particularly species-rich Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta reveal that yearling hadrosaurids were the greatest resource hogs of all, accounting most of the browsing pressure below 1 m. Shifts in diet during growth would have had important implications for dinosaur community structure and illuminate the importance of considering life history in studies of ecological interactions.

## Notes
- Based on her Master's thesis
- NA in the [[Cretaceous]]:
- ![[Pasted image 20230311162307.png]]
- Eastward flowing rivers:
- ![[Pasted image 20230311162324.png]]
- Lots of swamps &c
- Ankylosaurs, [[Ceratopsidae]] ([[Centrosaurines]] and [[Chasmosaurines]]); Hadrosaurs
- Juveniles of these groups
- Also some smaller herbivores
- [[Niche Partitioning]] (resource splitting) facilitates the coexistence of adult herbivores
- Research done on megaherbivores
- What were the young of large herbivores eating?
- Did the small adult herbivores eat the same things as the juveniles f the larger ones?
- Wouldn't the young eat the same as the adults?
	- Not necessarily
	- [[Ontogenetic Niche Shift]]
	- either because of changes in size or shape
	- OFten occurs when there are large changes in size during growth
		- e.g. alligators
		- Increase in prey size (bigger you are, the bigger the things you can eat)
		- ![[Pasted image 20230311162845.png]]
		- Changes in relative length of the snout
- Two main types of growth:
	- Proportionate growth: [[Isometric Growth]]
		- Only the size changes
	- Disproportionate growth: [[Allometric Growth]]
		- Changes in size and shape
		- Negative allometry: grows slower than the overall size
		- Positive allometry: grows faster than the overall size
- What about in [[Dinosauria]]
	- Yes - [[Limusaurus]] (A [[Theropoda]])
		- Loss of teeth with growth
		- Thoughts: young are omnivorous, then lose their teeth and become herbivorous
	- [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] 
		1. Increase skull robusticity
		2. Relative decrease in snout length
		3. Tooth shape changes from blade-like to more cone-like
			1. Also happens in alligators
		- Change in prey size and bite force
	- [[Diplodocus]]
		1. Widening of snout
		2. Lengthening of snout
		3. Change in tooth distribution: juvenile ([[Maxilla]] and [[Premaxilla]]) - adults (only [[Premaxilla]])
			1. juveniles pluck at everything - adults mowing down everything
		- ![[Pasted image 20230311163640.png]]
	- [[Ceratorpsids]] - [[Centrosaurines]] and [[Chasmosaurines]]
		- E.g. [[Triceratops]] and [[Pachyrhinosaurus]]
		- Changes to frills and horns
		- Uncertain if there are dietary changes
		- Significant changes in size with growth
			- (cat size -> larger than an elephant)
			- Dietary changs are likey
	- [[Hadrosauridae]] - [[Hadrosaurines]] and [[Lambeosaurines]]
		- [[Lambeosaurines]]
			- e.g. [[Hypacrosaurus]]
			- Changes to cranial crest
			- Changes in diet??
			- Changes in size - <5k -> > 5000kg
			- Again, dietary changes with growth are likely
- Skull morphometrics - see how skul measurements reflective ... differences changes with size
- Look at the snout shape - narrow -> more selective, wider -> less selective
- ![[Pasted image 20230311164214.png]]
- In [[Hadrosauridae]], we see lots of overlap - only differences are at the extremes (very large or very small individuals)
- May be a sampling issue (e.g. small individuals are unlikely to be found). Lack of overlap on the larger ones may be due to the fact that they are just bigger than everything else
- [[Ceratopsidae]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230311164400.png]]
- Again, lack of overlap at the extremes - may be sampling issues again
- Snout shape: despite no changes in snout shape, absolute size differences would have made young more selective
- Feeding reach / bite force: 
	- Young: short snout -> browsing
	- Old: long snout -> grazing
	- ![[Pasted image 20230311164551.png]]
	- Can reach more food at different heights
	- Muscles connecting at the back of the jaw -> if you have a longer jaw you have less bite force
	- Depression of the snout results in increase of relative bite force at the snout tip
	- (Mixed signals)
	- In [[Ceratopsidae]] we see two other changes
		- Juveniles:
			- Larger [[Coronoid Process]] - apex distance
			- Larger [[Quadrate Bone]] breadth
		- Decreasing relative resitance to torsion + attachment area - restiance to 'wobble'
		- Decrease in relative bite force
		- Again, a bit of a mixed signal
	- In the [[Hadrosauridae]]
		- Wider [[Paroccipital Process]] breadth in juveniles
		- ![[Pasted image 20230311165102.png]]
		- [[Paroccipital Process]]es are where some important neck muscles attach
		- Suggests that the neck muscles were less important as they grew
		- Browsers: grab a leaf and yank back (using head motion -> neck muslces)
		- Grazers: rely more on the bite force
	- Opposite patterns in [[Ceratopsidae]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230311165227.png]]
		- Suggests the opposite pattern
		- May be an artifiact of the fact that they have giant head ornamentation
- Interpretation: juvenile megaherbivores selectively fed on softer vegetation growing closer to the ground compared to their adult counterparts
- Change in diet w/ growth
- What's the bigger picture?
- Did the small adult herbivores eat the same thing as the bab megaherbivores?
- Did young dinosaurs 'share' the resources with the smaller ones?
- Size and types of [[Dinosauria]] indicates no!
- Modern ecosystems and ancient:
- ![[Pasted image 20230311165718.png]]
- Notice the gap!
- Researchers have suggested that it's because of the relative differences in juvenile vs. adult
- Dinosaur young started very small no matter how big the adults
- Mammals: not a huge difference in size with growth
- [[Dinosauria]] - young occupy different roles / niches 
- So the gap might be filled by young / teenagers of the larger ones
- Similar thing may be going on with the herbivores!
- Until her Master's thesis, no one had looked at this
- To share or not to share
- ![[Pasted image 20230311165937.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230311170005.png]]
- Late [[Cretaceous]] groups have different roles
- Other idea: they still had to share
- So what do we see?
- ![[Pasted image 20230311170118.png]]
- Closer to initial similarity and later divergence
- But some overlap
- So a bit of both scenarios
- Still needs to be looked into (some variables are unaccounted for)
- How well did the young dinosaurs share with the smaller ones?
- Relative amouts of food consumed per group in a given area
- Browse profiles against feeding heights
- Use the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] since it is so well sampled
- Take information from previous studies:
	- Body size
	- Growth rates
	- Population size
	- life-death rates
	- Metabolic rates
	- Feeding heights
- ![[Pasted image 20230311170421.png]]
- [[Hadrosauridae]] seem to be responsible for eating most above a certain height
- [[Ceratopsidae]] against the lower height
- At the smaller end:
- ![[Pasted image 20230311170541.png]]
- Where does this leave us?
- Previously: we knew the adults were partitioning
- At the smaller size:
	- [[Hadrosauridae]] and [[Ceratopsidae]] went fr om more picky -> less picky
- Some competition for food at small body sizes
	- Juvenile [[Hadrosauridae]] did not like 'sharing' their food!
- All her research is online

## Questions / Answers
- Is [[Ontogenetic Niche Partitioning]] found in modern birds?
	- Seems to be under-researched
	- Maybe yes?
- Because [[Dinosauria]] grew so rapidly, why would they be so picky when young?
	- Could be a niche issue - the adults are eating too much of the stuff you'd like to eat
- Is there any separation between the strategies between the different groups (e.g. [[Lambeosaurines]] vs. [[Hadrosaurines]])
	- Unclear - not enough fossils
- Given that small dinosaur are so underrepresented, how do you account for bias in sampling?
	- Good question
	- Cool math (e.g. random samping)
	- Can use [[Pachycephalosaurs]] skulls as a proxy since they preserve so well
	- Juvenile hadrosaurs are about the same size, so the bias probably applies the same to each
