# Chapter 2 - How to Study Fossil Vertebrates

## Digging up Bones

- New fossil localities are sometimes discovered (mostly by chance), but most excavations are done in already-known locations
- Look for fossils only in [[Sedimentary Rock]]
- Generally find large bones by prospecting - wandering around and looking
	- When fragments are found, follow them back to the source
	- Exact location of bones should be mapped as they are excavated
	- Geologists should be present to interpret the sedimentary context
- Isolate each bone / group of bones by digging a trench around them
	- Cover them with wet paper / foil
	- Cap with layers or burlap
	- Dig underneath
	- Cover with plaster
	- Each block may weight several tonnes

### Preparation and conservation of bones

- Highly skilled technicians work to remove the bones from the matrix
- Information is lost at each step of perparation - a good techician minimizes the loss
- Plaster jackets are cut off and as much of the matrix as possible is removed
- Treatments may be applied to the bone to strengthen them
- Handheld chisels, mechanical drills, brushes, &c. may be used to remove the sediment
- If the bones are in limestone, then a dilute acid may be used to remove it (although it risks removing any traces of the soft tissue)

### Display and study

- Spectacular new species or very complete specimens may be prepared for display
- Bones may be strung together on a metal or fibreglass framework
- Most specimens are never displayed, but are solely for research
- Paleontologists find out about specimens through published descriptions or print / online catalogues
- Try to reconstruct as much of the animal as completely as possible
	- Often difficult due to missing, damaged, or warped bones
- If the specimen represents a new species, a formal description must be published

## Publication and Professionalism

- Important to master "the literature" (scientific papers in the field) for several reasons:
	1. Know about the latest discoveries
	2. Become aware of the viewpoints in different fields
	3. Learn how scientists marshal their evidence and argue a case
	4. To see how professional scientists operate
- Especially important if you plan to become a paleontologist

### The scientific literature

- Vast magnitude, even in specialized subfields
- Set out a hypthesis and test it with data
- Three kinds of literature:
	1. Primary: journals that publish original observations and ideas
	2. Secondary: review articals and specialist textbooks written by practicing scientists
		- Presents an overview of a current topic
		- Tries to make a strong argument or set out a research agenda to help focus other researchers' efforts
	3. Tertiary: everything else: newspaper articles, popular books, websites, &c.

### How to write a scientific paper

- Read and discuss
- "You cannot hope to write a good paper if you do not read like a mad person"
- Read a lot, especially in your area of interest and in the hournals in which you hope to publish
- Discuss your ideas with fellow students and your professors
- Present posters / talks at conferences
- Have people criticize your poster and talk
- Run through it multiple times
- Scientific papers are constructd for ease of rapid reading
- Title and abstract will be read much more than the rest
- Title should be crisp and clear
- Abstract should be self-contained and short
- Order of approach should be:
	1. Materials and methods
	2. Results
	3. Supplementary data
	4. Introduction and discussion
	5. Regerences
	6. Title and abstract
- Begin writing the paper on the day you start the study
- "Material and methods" - write it as you do it
- Compile a detailed 'laboratory report' containing all of the information, graphs, analysis, &c. - these will eventually form the supplementary material
- If you have lots of raw data, you might store this in a recognized repository, like Dryad
- Illustrations are important - they can help clarify
- Introduction should be written after the results, &c. are all done
- Discussion should be about the implications of the research
- Title and Abstract are next
	- Aim for maximum understanding by the broadest roup of people
		- Including laypeople!
	- Should't be any citations, technical terms, or sidelines
- Final jobs are tidying up - Acknowledgements, References, &c.
- Now you go through the review process - other people look at your paper and critique it
- Must be ready for rejection and criticism

### Careers in vertebrate paleontology

- Many career paths, and many kinds of jobs
- Competition is intense
- Key jobs are in universities and museums
- Obvious path: undergraduate in geology, earth sciences, biology, or paleontology $\to$ MSc in Paleobiology, Systematics, Phylogenomics, or Museum studies $\to$ PhD

## Geology and Fossil Vertebrates

### Taphonomy

- [[Taphonomy]]
- When a fossil is preserved, it goes through a series of stages:
	1. Decay of the soft tissues
	2. Transport and breakage of hard tissues
	3. Burial and modifications of the hard tissues
- Certain vertebrates are found with exceptional preservation, where early mineralization has preserved even the soft tissues
	- Typically, the soft tissues are replaced by
		1. Pyrite,
		2. Phosphate, or
		3. Calcite
	- More unusual example may include preservation in [[Amber]], ice, or asphalt
- Transport processes usually disarticulate the skeleton
- Further transport typically causes abrasion and wear
- After transport, the specimen may be buried
	- Further damage, through e.g. through compaction because of the weight of overlying sediment
	- Hollow parts may collapse, and complex elements may be distorted
- After burial, organism may be affected by chemical chages
	- Minerals tend to crystallize out in cavities within the bone
- Compaction during uplift or folding out of the rock may further distort the fossil
- All examples of [[Diagenesis]]

### Continental drift

- [[Continental Drift]]
- 1912, [[Alfred Wegener]] proposed the idea, based largely off of fossil evidence
	- Focused on [[Gondwana]]
	- Similar fossil plants and animals
		- e.g. [[Lystrosaurus]], [[Mesosaurus]]
	- Ignored at the time due to lack of evidence for how this could be happening
- Driving mechanism is [[Plate Tectonics]]
	- [[Continental Drift]] is crucial in the study of vertebrates
	- Endemic vs. cosmopolitan
	- Upwelling magma have raised ocean floors (e.g. late [[Cretaceous]]) causing transgression, where the sea floods the land

### Ancient climates
- Evidence comes from detailed study of rocks and fossils
- Also: isotope measurements
	- Especially oxygen and carbon
- Sedimentary rocks can indicate climate
	- E.g. lots of coal $\to$ warm, humid conditions
	- Red-coloured sandstones and mudstones showing cycles of dramatic flooding and then mudcracked surfaces $\to$ Monsoonal climates
	- Irregular limestone bodies in ancient soils ([[Caliche]]) indicates dramatic seasonal rainfall and rapid drying
	- Ice scratches on rocks and [[Glacial Tills]] $\to$ freezing conditions

## Biology and fossil vertebrates

### Functional morphology

- [[Functional Morphology]]: the interpretation of *function* from *morphology*
- Main assumption is that structures are adapted in some way and are reasonably efficient at what they do
	- e.g. giraffes have long necks to enable them to eat leaves from taller trees
- Can infer the presence of muscles due to *muscle scars* on the bones or processes where they would have attached
- Several approaches:
	- Comparison to a living animal (espec. if the fossil under study is part of an extant group)
	- [[Extant Phylogenetic Bracket]] (Witmer, 1997)
	- Mechanical and mathematical models (biomechanical studies)
		- [[Finite Element Analysis]]: break the bone (or whatever) into very small sections and model the stress / strain on different sections

### Palaeoecology

- Study of ancient modes of live and interactions
	- Focus may be a community as a whole or a single animal
- Modes of life can be inferred from the bones and teeth
- With enough specimens, may be able to determine [[Sexual Dimorphism]] and / or [[Ontogeny]]
- In some site, may be possible to draw a food web

## Discovering Phylogeny

- Two main analytical techniques for determining phylogenies:
	- Cladistic analysis of morphological data
	- Molecular phylogeny

### Cladistic analysis of morphological characters

- Main method used to determine the relationship of living and fossil vertebrates
- Final result is a cladogram
- Cladogram is constructed after an assessment of characters
- Outgroup comparison: when studyin a group, you want to include an *outgroup*
	- A group that is definitely outside what you're studying, but not too far
	- Serves to *polarize* the characters - let's you know what is primitive and what is derived
- Monophyletic: group arising from a single ancestor
	- AKA clade
- Paraphyletic: Includes the most primite descendants of a common ancestor, but may exclude more derived ones
	- e.g. common understanding of dinosaurs, where the basal ones are included but the derived birds are not
- Polyphyletic: arose from serveral ancestors and are diagnosed by a convergent feature (e.g. whales and fishes being grouped together because they swin in the sea)
-[[Analogy]] vs. [[Homology]] can make things difficult

### Molecular phylogeny reconstruction

- Another approach is to compare molecules from different organisms
- Can be used to tell time of separation between species (molecular clock)
- e.g. comparing different DNA sites: align the strands and look at the differences
- Distance methods seek a tree that best summarizes all of teh relative distance information among the species in the analysis
- Three distance methods are commonly used:
	1. UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean): produces a tree in which all of the tips are equidistant from the root of the tree, which is equivalent to assuming a molecular clock
	2. NK (Neighbour joining): pair off apparently similar species and then make links between the mmore distantly related clades until the tree is complete - quick but not necessarily very accurate
	3. ME (Minimum evolution): seek to minimize the sum of the lengths of all branches in the tree
- Alternative to distance methods: *discrete methods*, which operate directly on the  sequences or functions derived from the sequences
	1. MP (Maximum parsimony): analogous to tree finding with morphological data - seeks the tree with the fewest evolutionary changes.
	2. ML (Maximum likelihood): choose the tree or trees that are most likely to have produced the observed data. Requires the input of a model of evolution that expresses assumptions of rates of evolutionary change and relative probability of different base-pair changes
- Most widespread tree calculation methods are [[Bayesian Statistics|Bayesian]]

## Quality of the fossil record

- Key questions: is the quality of the fossil record good enough to answer the question you are interested in?
- May be a bias: when more fossil-bearing rocks are formed, we find more records from that time -> looks like there is more diversity
	- Similarly, number of fossil species and exposures of rocks from that time are highly correlated
	- This is the [[Bias Hypothesis]] - close covariance of rock record and fossil record
	- Two alternatives:
		- [[Common Cause Hypothesis]] - the same process could cause more increased diversity and more rock record - e.g. sea level change - as shallow seas expand that makes more habitat and is also conducive to more rock being formed
		- [[Redundancy Hypothesis]] - The records track each other because when there is more rock, we naturally find more fossils from there - the two measures are basically equivalent.

## Macroevolution

- Evolution of life above the species level
- Broad-scale paterns of diversification and extinction events
- [[Cope's Rule]] - species tend to become larger over time
- Most studies are done using *phylogenetic comparative methods*, where diversity and trait data are mapped onto a phylogeny
- Brownian motion model of evolution: evolution is random (random walk model)
	- Often used as the null hypothesis in comparative studies
- Evolutionary rate: how quickly characters are changing
- Disparity: measure or morphological variation (how different are things?)
- apomorphies and plesiomorphies
