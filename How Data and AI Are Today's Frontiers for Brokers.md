- Trends to watch in insurance: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230719090307.png]]
- [[Artifical Intelligence|AI]] is a whole new world
- 5 different types
	- Machine learning
	- Natural language processing
	- Computer vision
	- Robots
	- Expert systems / generative
		- e.g. [[ChatGPT]]
- Challenge from the broker's perspective: how do you get all of the data you have?
	- Too much is stored in e.g. paper files
	- Plus a single brokerage probably doesn't have enough data to do too much interesting
- Apparently this is where [[Trufla]] comes in: bringing AI to brokerages

- Three different tools:
	- SEO data module
		- Powering client acquisitions
		- "There is no industry more competitive online than insurance"
		- How to use data to turbochage the website
		- Loads in live data and refreshes regularly - apparently this helps with SEO?
	- Predictive rating
		- Powering client acquisition
		- Can we use data to get a predictive rate more quickly?
		- 93% accuracy in less than 30s (how are they measuring their accuracy?)
	- Customer retention
		- Apparently it's 6-7 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an old one
		- Predictive tool for clients that are a risk of being lost
		- Can see a 2% improvement in retention
