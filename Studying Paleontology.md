# Studying Paleontology
## Curriculum / Ideas
- [University of Alberta Paleontology Program](https://www.ualberta.ca/science/dinosaurs/study-paleontology.html)
	- MOOCS
		- [Homepage for all of them](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/index.html)
		- [Dino 101](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/dino101/index.html)
	- Good course listing
	- Difficulty to find details - lots of the course webpages seem to ... not be there. Also difficult finding textbooks.
- [University of Toronto Paleontology](https://future.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-programs/paleontology/)
	- Very scanty resources
- [Paleontological Research Institution - I Want to be a Paleontologist](https://www.priweb.org/blog-post/i-want-to-be-a-paleontologist)
