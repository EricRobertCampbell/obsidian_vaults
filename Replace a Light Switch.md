- Turn the breaker off
- Take off the plate
- Pull the switch proper out of the wall and test the circuits to ensure that there really is no current running through it
- Black wires are hot - copper wire attached to a green screw is the ground
- Take them off
- Put them on the new light switch and tighten the screws
- Wrap in electrical tape
- Put back in the wall, turn on the breaker, and test that it works
- Put the cover plate back on
