# New discoveries from Alberta reshape our understanding of tyrannosaur biology

**Authors**: [[Jared Voris]]

## Summary

## Abstract
```

```

## Notes
- [[Tyrannosauridae]] were the apex predators in [[North America]]
- Small, 2-fingered forelimbs
- Deep skulls
- Really thick, concial teeth
	- Bone-crushing
- Pretty diverse group
- Very diverse fossil record
- Also generally well-preserved

### Growth and Ontogeny
- Ontogeny - Carr and Williamson 2004
- [[Gorgosaurus]] - important for understanding ontogeny
- We have several younger individuals
	- e.g. the very complete one the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology]]
	- Not a juvenile, but a subadult
	- Horns on the [[Postorbital Bone]] and [[Lacrimal Bone]]
	- Other characteristics
	- Display structures
		- Don't appear until sexual maturity
	- Histology - evidence that it was in the 'rapid growth' phase
		- Hence: "subadult"
- Well-articulated speciments
- Lack of display strutures -> probably a juvenile
- With [[Gorgosaurus]] we have lots of juveniles - we can track changes over time
- Juvenile -> Adult:
	- Growth of display structures
	- Increasing robusticity of the skeleton
		- Looks like the juveniles were occupying the [[Mesopredator]] role
- [[Heterochrony]]
	- [[Paramorphosis]]???? this doesn't seem to be a word
	- If you are getting large, there are two ways to do that:
		- Grow for a longer time
		- Grow faster
		- Can start growing earlier
	- Which one strategy are the [[Tyrannosauridae]] using?
	- So what is going on?
- [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] is more derived and [[Gorgosaurus libratus]] more basal -> we can compare their growth patterns
- Compare the growth curves for these two species
	- Undergo a lot of the same changes
	- Difference in timing
	- [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] starts growing quickly *after* [[Gorgosaurus libratus]]
	- [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] are older at maturity
	- We have specimens of [[Tyrannosaurus Rex|T-Rex]] which are older than the oldest known [[Gorgosaurus libratus]]
	- Conclusion: [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] growth stops later compared to [[Gorgosaurus libratus]]

### New Species Taxonomy
- Rich dinosaur fossil res????
- [[Foremost Formation]]
	- Extensive formation in southern [[Alberta]]
	- Fossils are rare
	- Marginal environment
	- Shark teeth, turtle shells - fewer dinosaurs
		- [[Xenoceratops]]
		- [[Colepiocephale]]
	- Expect a similar ecological group as the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]
 - New [[Tyrannosauridae|Tyrannosaurid]]
	 - Not very complete
	 - Luckily, some diagnostic features
	 - [[Thanatotheristes degrootum]]
	 - Earlier than the other known NA [[Tyrannosauridae]]
	 - Displays features of both the North American and Asian [[Tyrannosauridae]]
	 - Original hypothesis:
		 - Closest to [[Daspletosaurus]]
		 - Turned out to be some data issues
		 - New data set being created
		 - Might fall outside of the [[Daspletosaurs]] - might be closest to the Asian [[Tyrannosauridae]]
	- Whichever is correct, important to our understanding of when the [[Tyrannosauridae]] / [[Daspletosaurs]] split happened
	- Hypothesis: about 80Ma, [[Thanatotheristes degrootum]] lived in NA, splitting of the lineage from [[Tyrannosaurus Rex|T-Rex]]
		- Later, at the tail end of the [[Cretaceous]], [[Tyrannosaurus Rex|T-Rex]] came from [[Asia]] into [[North America|NA]]
		- Then the [[K-Pg Extinction]] happened
	- Adds to the diversity of older [[Tyrannosauridae]]
	- Helps to close the "[[Tyrannosaur Fossil Gap]]" 
	- Before the gap: they were pretty small
	- After: they were huge
	- What happened in between?
	- The large-bodied tyrannosaurs evolved right in the fossil gap
- Future: look into the gap
- One avenue: the [[Milk River Formation]]
	- About 83 Ma - older than [[Thanatotheristes degrootum]]
	- There was a tooth found from there - if only we had the rest of the animal!
