## 3 Notes
- [[Boardwalk Insurance]]
- Focused on UX for brokers (and hence customers)
- Customers are especially confused by the complexity of commercial insurance
- Brokers are limited by
	- Backend process inefficiencies
	- Required to collect too much information
	- Incomplete submissions and misguided marketing efforts
- Customer complaints:
	- Asking for too much information
	- Why is it taking so long to get the quote back to me
	- I can't reach my broker
	- Policy isn't clear - is this comparable to what I had?
- Up to a certain point, could provide good customer service. Above a certain size, they were too tied up in a backend process $\to$ worse customer relationship
- Really like how the focus is on customers: the more the system does for the broker, the better customer service can be
