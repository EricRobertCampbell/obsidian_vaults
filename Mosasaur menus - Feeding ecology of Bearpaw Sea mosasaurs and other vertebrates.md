## Summary

## Abstract
```

```

## Notes
- [[Mosasaurs]]
- [[Squamata]], like lizards and whatnot. [[Mosasaurs]] seem to be closely related to [[Monitor Lizards]]
- Late [[Cretaceous]] - 90 - 66 Ma
- Died off in the [[K-Pg Extinction]]
- Late Cretaceous:
	- Hothouse world
	- Small inland seas were everywhere
	- High sea levels
- [[Mosasaurs]] and [[Plesiosaurs]] were the dominant marine reptiles
- Replaced large predatory fish
- [[Ammonite]] show gigantism
- Study their teeth
	- What did they eat and how did they interact?
- 2D microwear
	- Scratches in the teeth from their feeding behaviour
	- Coarse scratches vs. pits
	- ![[20230329_065539.jpg]]
	- Can also do 3D scans to get a better picture
	- DMTA
	- Can then analyze using [[Principal Components Analysis|PCA]]
	- Use Enegy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)
		- Attachment to a scanning electron microscope
	- Want to measure [[Strontium]] / [[Calcium]]
		- at every step up the food chain, [[Strontium]] is replaced by [[Calcium]]
		- Measuring the ratio tells you something about how high up the food chain the animal is
		- Measure for lots of marine reptiles (and sawfish)
		- Generally supports the evidence from the wear patterns
	- [[Carbon]] isotope informtion tells us something about the diet and where it is on the food chain
	- [[Oxygen]] isotope information: salinity and temperature
	- [[Strontium]] isotopes: migration
		- Different areas can have different signatures: different signatures in the teeth -> migration
	- When they dive, they can get the bends and change the isotope composition ($^{13}C$) 
		- Bigger ones seem to dive deeper
	- $^{18}O$ - spikes indicating that they went to freshwater
	- $\delta^{13}C$ - evidence from the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology]] seems to confirm that larger ones dove deeper
	- Compare to other animals from the [[Bearpaw Sea]]
		- Everything seems to be in roughly the same range
		- [[Mosasaurs]] had the widest range
		- [[Tylosaurus]] seems to be an outlier
	- $\delta^{18}O$
		- [[Prognathodon]] had the widest range
			- Possibly because it move inshore, then offshore
		- [[Tylosaurus]] is an outlier again
	- $^{87}Sr / ^{86}Sr$ pilot study
		- Wide range with [[Prognathodon]]
		- May be evidence for inshore / offshore migration

### Conclusion
- [[Niche Partitioning]] indicated by EDX
- [[Habitat Partitioning]] indicated by $\delta^{18}O$ and $^{87}Sr / ^{86}Sr$ pilot
- Next steps: more [[Strontium]] research!

#### Q / A
- This focused on the [[Enamel]] - otherpeople sampled the [[Dentin]]
- Shale is composed of [[Bentonite]] - very good at excluding water
