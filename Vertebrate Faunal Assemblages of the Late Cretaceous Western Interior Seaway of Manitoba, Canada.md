# Vertebrate Faunal Assemblages of the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of Manitoba, Canada

## Summary

## Abstract
```
The Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of Manitoba was once home to a number of creatures. Aaron Kilmury's talk transports listeners to what life was like for small vertebrates when much of Manitoba was covered in water. Kilmury's masters thesis re-examines the vertebrate community zonation hypothesis, a topic that has not been looked at in more than 30 years. Comparing Manitoba's fossil record with other places in North America, Kilmury discovers that a strong size bias exists toward the overrepresentation of large-bodied vertebrates. Kilmury's study of microvertebrate assemblages was conducted to counteract this size bias, and has revealed several significant discoveries, including new microvertebrate material.

## Notes
- Talk about his Master's research
- As part of the project he did lots of community outreach (espec. to indigenous communities)

### Outline

### MB Escarpment Vertebrate Fossil Collection Biases
- [[Western Interior Seaway]]
	- Semi-tropical interior seaway
	- [[Ichthyornis]] (birds), [[Tylosaurs]], &c.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230411151330.png]]
	- [[WIS Community Zonation Hypothesis]]
		- Looking at age-equivalent fossils
		- Northern interior subprovince
			- Low diversity in al groups
			- [[Hesperornithiformes]], [[Plesiosaurs]]
			- [[Mosasaurs]] - [[Platecarpus]]
		- Southern Interior Subprivince
			- High diversity
			- Turtles, sharks
			- [[Mosasaurs]] - [[Clidastes]]
	- Big question - reassessment for [[Campanian]] - does it hold?
	- Recent data including radiometric ages - more reliable correlations for age (espec. in [[Manitoba]])
	- Means that late [[Cretaceous]] fossils in [[Manitoba]] have the potential to answer large-scale questions about [[Western Interior Seaway]] biogeography
	- [[Manitoba Escarpment Formation]]:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230411151547.png]]
		- Composed mostly of 5 highs
		- Covers most of the late [[Cretaceous]]
		- What biases are present in the assemblages and how can they be addressed
- Fossil Collection biases
	- ![[Pasted image 20230411152044.png]]
	- Preferential sampling of certain groups and certain geologic units
	- E.g. for the [[Belle Fourche Formation]], it is well sampled with lots of shark teeth
	- E.g. [[Pembina Formation]] - [[Bentonite]] mining
	- Larger size classes are generally more preserved and easier to collect (/ find)
- So what do we do about it?
- ![[Pasted image 20230411152412.png]]
- [[Tetrapoda]] fossils were used to define the zones, not the fish or whatever
- One goal: if we include these other groups, do the zones change?
- ![[Pasted image 20230411152543.png]]
- Community similarity calculations
	- Multidimensional calculations:
		- [[Non-metric multidimensional scaling]] (NMDS)
		- RStudio *MetaMDS* function, vegan
	- Pairwise calculations
		- Uses a central location ([[Manitoba]] in this case) and then comparing each to that
		- [[Sorensen's Coefficient of Community]] using presence-absence data
		- Percent Similarity using relative abundance data
		- Biogeographic correlations based on genus-level PS values
- ![[Pasted image 20230411152845.png]]
- Only time bin with sufficient sample size
- 8 genera shared between 3 or more sites

### Western Interior Seaway Biogeography
- Pairwise results
	- Comparison of fossil assemblages of ages in 9 time intervals shows communit zones change over time
	- ![[Pasted image 20230411153230.png]]
- Percent similarit and lithology correlations
	- ![[Pasted image 20230411153421.png]]
	- Seems to be that communities with similar lithology are more similar

### Small-Bodied Vertebrates of the MB Favel Formation
- [[Favel Formation]]
- Went to field sites and took bulk samples from the early, middle, and late horizons
- Over 1550 microvertebrate fossils!
- 15 new species for the [[Favel Formation]]
- Approx. 590 vetebrae measured
- Built a fossil sorting guides!
- "An Illustrated Guide to Microvertebrate Fossils of Late Cretaceous Manitoba"
- Teeth of [[Rhinobatos incertus]]
	- Guitarfish
- Bits on the rostrum of the sawfish
- Teeth, &c. of [[Micropycnodon kansasensis]]
- New for [[Manitoba]]
	- [[Ptychodus marginalis]]
	- Also some [[Mosasaurs]]
	-  [[Thryptodus loomisi]]
- Preservational Bias
	- measured vertebra diameter at different places, near and offshore
	- ![[Pasted image 20230411154710.png]]

### Conclusions
- Size bias, the most prevalent bias, can be counteracted with sampling nd description of microvertebrate horizons and from undersampled formations
- [[Western Interior Seaway]] vertebrate communities experienced *at least* 2-part N-S zonation throughout the late [[Cretaceous]]
- [[Favel Formation]] microvertebrate analyses suggests that small-bodied vertebrate communities were diverse and occupied a relatively nearshore environment during the mid-[[Turonian]] time

### Q / A
- Got some radiometric ages - which formations in [[Manitoba]] correspond to the ones in [[Alberta]]?
	- &c.
- Any genera found in both [[Manitoba]] and [[Alberta]]?
	- Yup - some sharks, &c.
- Could the unknown fossil be a gill cover?
	- Yes - definitely one of the possibilities. Could also be a [[Caudal Fin]].
- Considering the new technologies, what is the future of microfossil studies?
	- Disapointed he couldn't use [[Non-metric multidimensional scaling]] - maybe the use of microfossils could help with this?
	- Also a geographic bias - lots in the US, fewer in [[Canada]]
- Tell us more about the giant shark ([[Ptychodus marginalis]])?
	- Feeding on shelled prey
- One of the sharks ([[Ptychodus marginalis]]) made it look very large, but it had small teeth. What is the diet?
	- Maybe some filter feeding?
- Next steps?
	- Project opened up lots of research questions
	- Wants to get some age determinations
	- Hard because the volcanoes are mostly to the west
- What invertebrate fossils did you find in the deposit with the others?
	- Clam shells
	- No insects
	- Maybe some mysterios calcareous algae?
- Laws in [[Alberta]] vs. [[Manitoba]] for collecting fossils?
	- Some differences
	- Generally quite similar
	- Need to apply for a Heritage Permit to collect
		- Different for different sites
	- Need to provide permissions, &c.
	- Details of what areas and that you have permission to collect there
	- Difference between surface collection and digging
