## 1 Abstract
> The necessity of embracing a Responsible AI approach has become paramount in the midst of the rapid development of AI-powered technologies. Central to this need is the imperative to cultivate a solid culture of AI ethics and a non-deterministic approach to technological adoption. In this context, ethical data management is vital to Responsible and Trustworthy AI.

> This culture extends beyond compliance. It involves not only collecting and processing data following legal requirements but also making morally sound decisions about data usage. Responsible AI demands careful consideration of not just what data we use but also the “how” and “why” of data. Developing an ethical culture for data management can positively impact fairness as one of the pivotal principles of Responsible AI. This process implies a profound examination of how different groups and identities are represented within datasets. Striving for fairness is not solely about avoiding discrimination but also embracing methods and strategies to mitigate historical biases embedded in the data. Organizations must scrutinize their data sources, acknowledging that biased data can perpetuate social injustices and reinforce existing inequalities.

> This assessment should comprehensively evaluate how AI applications impact the rights and well-being of individuals and communities affected by the systems. Organizations can proactively mitigate potential harms by assessing AI development in a human rights framework and promoting equitable, responsible AI practices.In the journey toward Responsible AI, establishing a culture of ethics built upon ethical data management is critical. The practices and principles adopted by organizations to manage their data should be anchored into a broader culture of AI ethics and responsible AI, comprehensively built.  By attending this conference, participants will deepen their understanding of the ethical considerations to embrace Responsible AI. By the end, they will be able to: **‍**

> **1. Enhanced awareness of AI's societal impact:** Participants will gain a deeper understanding of how AI systems can impact society, including potential negative consequences like perpetuating biases and inequalities. This awareness is crucial for developing AI that is beneficial and non-discriminatory.

>‍ **2. Identify socio-technical approaches to mitigate bias in AI:** The conference will cover experiences and methods to identify and mitigate historical and inherent biases in AI datasets and algorithms. Participants will be invited to reflect on the importance of diverse and representative datasets.

>‍ **3. Identity practices for cultivating an ethical AI culture in organizations:** The conference will provide insights on how organizations can establish and nurture a culture of AI ethics. This involves integrating ethical data management practices into the broader organizational culture and ensuring that these practices are adhered to at all levels.
