. With - often done wa with 
- only bivariate (rvsx)
- e.g. Brain mass v. Size
- (for allometry)
- or sometimes you went to measure genetic distance vs. Physical distance
- OLS predict y grant; SMA estimates the line that best describes the scatter
- OLS you are interested in the p-value of the slope, predicted y, R2
- SMA you are interested in to slope woeffiend (effect size) on intercept you can still preduk a y, and you yet on dented R2
- man paper is "bivaridiline-guttin methods for allometry "
