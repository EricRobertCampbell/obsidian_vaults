- Preservation and Diversity of Small Dinosaurs
- Based on two papers:
- ![[Pasted image 20230531191601.png]]
- [[Dinosauria]] got really big!
- ![[Pasted image 20230531191627.png]]
- Quantify the sizes by looking at the size distribution
- ![[Pasted image 20230531191706.png]]
- More [[Dinosauria]] are big than small
- Mammals have the exact opposite trend: more smaller ones than large ones
- ![[Pasted image 20230531191745.png]]
- Looking at basically every other group of [[Vertebrata]], they all show a negative [[Skew]]!
	- ![[Pasted image 20230531191822.png]]
- Implications for biology:
	- Community structure
	- [[Niche Partitioning]]
	- Energetics
	- [[Ontogenetic Niche Shift|Ontogenetic Shifts]]
	- Competition
	- Extinction
- Two ways to interpret this:
	- Biological vs. [[Taphonomy|taphonomic]]
	- i.e. it could be real, or it could be a distortion of the signal caused by [[Taphonomy]] processes
	- ![[Pasted image 20230531192018.png]]
	- Not yet been quantified in a [[Mesozoic]] ecosystem
	- ![[Pasted image 20230531192106.png]]
	- Very good sampling -> good to use for studies
	- Large range of body masses, &c.
	- All from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531192206.png]]
	- Diversity:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531192229.png]]
	- Again, we get a negative skew
	- Took the different [[Dinosauria]] and get a body mass estimate for all of them
		- used different methods:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531192327.png]]
	- Correlate very nicely with the masses
	- ![[Pasted image 20230531192349.png]]
	- Get an idea of the mass along with the error
	- Then took four different taphonomic indices
		- When was the first specimen found
		- Date described
		- Skeletal completeness (Mannion and Upchurch, 2010)
			- Done at the species level
			- Looked at every specimen until 100% completeness or out of specimens
			- Done with different regions of the skeleton, and then take an average
			- ![[Pasted image 20230531192618.png]]
		- Taphonomic mode (Eberth and Currie)
			- ![[Pasted image 20230531192644.png]]
			- Independent of completeness
		- $H_0$ - taphonomic indicators are independent of body mass
			- Lack of taphonomic size bias
		- $H_a$ - taphonomic indicators are correlated with body masses
		- How does body size relate to completeness?
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531192959.png]]
		- Can also break it down by group; same pattern holds
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531193122.png]]
		- Can also rank smallest $\to$ largest and see the completeness
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531193216.png]]
		- Seems to be about 60kg is the limit - under that is basically always isolatd
			- Also about 370 kg  -> almost entirely complete
		- Some sort of analysis find the same thing
			- ![[Pasted image 20230531193330.png]]
			- Sliding mean difference?
		- Threshold is slightly different for [[Ornithiscia]] and [[Theropoda]]
	- Taphonomic mode
		- Same kind of pattern - small are isolated, medium are associated, large are articulated
	- Timing of discovery and description
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531193647.png]]
		- Notice - lots of large were found early, and the smaller ones found later
		- Time of discovery (rather than description) makes this more stark:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531193803.png]]
		- Mathematically:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531193829.png]]
		- Also have an idea of who was collecting there and when
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531193919.png]]
		- Rate of discovery against collection intensity:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230531194010.png]]
		- Large ones seem basically done, and the small ones are still increasing
			- If the curves hold, we will get a higher diversity of small dinosaurs
	- Diversity of families
		- Very small correlation, largely driven by [[Hadrosauridae]] and [[Ceratopsia]]
	- Small taxa or small skeletons? i.e. what about the small examples (e.g. young) of larger taxa?
		- Looked at [[Centrosaurus]] and the [[Hadrosauridae]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20230606165004.png]]
			- Looked at the [[Occipital Condyle]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20230606165030.png]]
			- So it looks like we get a roughly similar pattern as with taxa overall $\to$ the issue seems to be the size, not anything to do with the taxa themselves
- Is this unique to the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]? I.e. did they just choose a bad place to test this?
	- Ideally test another place with a 
		- Similar depositional environment
		- Different place
		- different taxa
		- Different time
		- Different collection history
	- Looked at the [[Hell Creek Formation]]
		- Looking at the results, see a very similar pattern
		- ![[Pasted image 20230606165459.png]]
		- In fact, even that 60kg threshold is the same
- Historical viewpoint
	- E.g. what would this talk look like 30 years ago?
	- Look at size comparisons over time
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606165635.png]]
	- Can plot the skew over time
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606165654.png]]
- Going back to the hypotheses:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606165731.png]]
- Means that we are missing small [[Dinosauria]]!
- Size bias in terrestrial mammals:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606165837.png]]
	- Even here there is a disconnect between the bones and the live animals
	- Seem to be losing the diversity of the small animals
- What does this mean?
	- Most [[North America]] dinosaur formation are underrepresented in small [[Dinosauria]]
	- Paleoecological studies need to account for this bias and the missing diversity / abundances that resut
	- If we want to understand [[Dinosauria]] diversity, we need to concentrate on the small taxa
	- Unforunately, specimens of small taxa will be rare and incomplete :(
- Some advances:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606170211.png]]
	- Important because they're quite small!
	- Known only from isolated jaws
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606170308.png]]
	- Medium-sized animals
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606170346.png]]
	- First occurence of the [[Microraptoridae]] in [[North America]]; we thought they went extinct may millions of years before
	- ![[Pasted image 20230606170426.png]]
	- May be insectivorous!
	- Also there are some new small ones that haven't been named yet!
