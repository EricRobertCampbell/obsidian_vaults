## Summary

## Notes
- How are birds related to dinosaurs?
- Avian and non-avian dinosaurs
- When did dinosaurs start being birds?
	- Societal level: when did we understand that birds are dinosaurs?
	- Teporal: when did dinosaurs become birds?
- Taxonomy: how biologists group organisms into groups
	- Family tree for groups rather than individuals
- Dinosaur family tree:
- ![[Pasted image 20230219124639.png]]
- Dinosaur ancestor in the [[Triassic]]
- Two major groups of [[Dinosaur]]:
	- [[Ornithiscia|Ornithiscian]] (bird-hipped)
	- [[Saurithiscia|Saurithiscian]] (lizard-hipped)
- What clues are there that birds are dinosaurs?
	1. Feathers
		- Lots of dinosaurs had feathers
		- E.g. [[Archeopteryx]] probably was a flyer (and definitely had feathers)
		- Most feathered dinosaurs were too heavy to fly
		- Probably the original use was for warmth and display
	2. Scaly feet
		- Lots of bird feet look almost exactly the same as dinosaur ones
	3. Hollow bones
		- Lots of big air holes in the bones
		- Strong but light
		- Why did dinosaurs have hollow bones?
			- Therapods and sauropods both have hollow bones
	4. Air sacs
		- We breathe in, and then breathe out
		- "Tidal breathing"
		- Dinosaurs (including birds) have extra air sacs where they can store air - they can breathe in and out at the same time
		- More efficient and effective respiration
		- Intrusion of the air sacs into the bones
	5. "Swivel wrist"
		- ![[Pasted image 20230219125826.png]]
		- The wrist can 'fold' so the hand is right up against the body
		- Evolved in the small therapods
		- Probably initially for prey capture
		- Evolved into the flight stroke of birds
	6. Laying eggs in nests and incubating them
		- Largely from the discovery of the [[Oviraptor]]
		- Assumed that the dinosaur was stealing the eggs (hence the name)
		- Later discovery: it was actually brooding them
	7. Bipedalism
		- Evolved in dinosaurs (very early)
		- forelimbs free to evolve into wings
	8. "Wishbone" (Furcula)
		- First evolved in dinosaurs (e.g. [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]])
		- Merging of the two shoulderblades
		- Part of the flight stroke in birds
	9. Cloaca
		- Single hole used for excretion, mating, &c.
		- E.g. [[Psittacosaurus]] - preserved cloaca
	10. DNA
		- Carry a lot of dinosaur DNA
		- Can mess with a chicken's genes to e.g. grow teeth, hands, bony tail, &c.
		- Birds and crocodiles are much more closely related than we thought
		- (Both are [[Archosaurs]])
