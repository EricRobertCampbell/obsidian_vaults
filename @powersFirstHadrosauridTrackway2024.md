## 1 Summary

## 2 Abstract
```
The Horseshoe Canyon Formation has provided a wealth of vertebrate skeletal fossils over the past 100 years of collection. Vertebrate trace fossils such as footprints and trackways, however, have been markedly underrepresented. Trackways can provide a wealth of information regarding behaviour and soft tissues reflective of autopodial anatomy. Discovery of several giant, high-fidelity ichnites in series from the Morrin Member represents the first definitive dinosaur trackway reported from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The trackway is composed of three footprint casts in series, alongside 22 associated ichnites. The ichnites were formed in soft sediment molds along a non-uniform walking surface. The deep substrates allowed for the preservation of both the plantar surface and dorsal components of the trackmakersâ€™ feet. Some ichnites show soft tissue morphologies like interdigital webbing, toe pads, and skin impressions. Presence of these features and small kidney-shaped forelimb prints allow referral to Hadrosauropodus langstoni. The preservation of the trackway demonstrates asymmetries useful for comparison of the relief and impression surfaces of prints using both discrete and morphometric characteristics, improving confidence in identifying partial or isolated Hadrosauropodus prints of various modes of formation.

## 3 Notes
- [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]]
- Lots of work on estimating hip height (and hence speed, from the stride length) from the trackways
- Apparently siding a track (determining whether it is from the left or right foot) is important but the quantitative methods are lacking.
- Found near [[Morrin Bridge]]
- [[Lone Spruce Trackway]]
	- [[Red Deer River Valley]]
- Mix of conventional mapping methods and [[Photogrammetry]]
- [[Morrin Member]] of the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation|HCF]] is directly above the [[Horsethief Member]]
	- Shows decrease in channel deposits and an abundance of green [[Mudstone]], likely representing [[Vertisol]] [[Palaeosols]]
	- Upper boundary of the [[Morrin Member]] is demarcated by the maximum flooding surface of the [[Drumheller Marine Tongue]]
- "Convex epirelief" - sediment infilling the trackway
- Idea of 'siding' a track - determining whether it's a left or right track
- Analytical methods are lacking - Something to look into?
- Used [[Principal Components Analysis]] and [[Linear Discriminant Analysis]]
- [[Jackknife algorithms]]?
- Variation in the tracks -> uneven surface? Differences in water saturation or level?
- [[Hadrosauopodus langstoni]]
- Asymmetrical [[Metatarsals|metatarsal]] impressions -> help to side the tracks
- Estimate hip height and speed
- "PC3 is also significant for this dataset" - how can a principal component be significant?
- Upward fining of sediment indicates that it may have been formed on a [[Scroll Bar]]
	- bar formed on the inside bank of a river as e.g. sand is deposited
- Several ideas as to why there are so few forelimb tracks 
	- seem to be generally rarer; easier to weather out / not be formed in the first place
- Trackmaker: track was compared to known [[Hadrosaurines|hadrosaurs]] known from the region
	- [[Edmontosaurus]]
	- [[Saurolophus osborni]]
	- [[Corythosaurus casuarius]]
	- [[Hypacrosaurus]]
- Not clear because there are few body fossils from this unit
- Probably some sort of [[Hadrosauridae|saurolophine hadrosaur]]
## 4 Next Steps / Ideas
- Look into the analytical methods of siding a track?
- Track siding might be a fun way to practice categorical regression
- Look into [[Principal Components Analysis|PCA]] - so many papers use it!
- For some reason they get slightly different results when they standardize the length measurements or not - is it because only some of the measurements are normalized? Like the angles stay the same but the measurements are changed?
