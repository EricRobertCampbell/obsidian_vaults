- [[Gleb Bahmutov]]
- [[cypress]]
- `cypress-grep` plugin to manage tags

- Reducing flake
	- spy on the graphql calls
	- cy.wait('@thegraphqlcall')
	- "set graphql operation name as custom header and use it in cy.intercept" video
	- [[testrail]] - apparently a place to keep track of tests? Also manual tests can be recorded there
	- Also you can use ??`cy.request`?? to check whether a link goes somewhere and doesn't result in a 404
