## 1 Prepare to Scale
### 1.1 Introduction
- Execute on finding product-market fit, finding customer, and building a predictable and scalable revenue pipeline
- Have to consistently work at it
- Can't just go through the steps and that's it - you need to be continually doing this
- Final section is the playbook to execute on the product-market fit, process of making an ICP a customer, and to scale
- In most cases, this is the longest part of the program (months to years)
- Cover:
	- Run a data-driven strategic pipeline review
	- Develop and implement an onboarding framework
		- What's the best framework to keep in customers and getting new ones?
	- Product-market feedback loop
		- As new features are being developed, how is that informed by the market? How are the new features communicated to the market?
	- Framework for recycling ICPs
	- Wrap up by revisiting the talent roadmap
		- Who needs to be brought on board to scale revenue?
## 2 Pipeline Management
### 2.1 Critical Concepts
- Need to be involved in everything going on with the market development
- Hold a regular (weekly) strategic pipeline meeting
- Where you ahve the most control over your go-to-market efforts
- Track the progress, analyze the data, &c. to understand what;s working and what isn't
- Going to market with intent
- Don't overcorrect, overpivot, or overlook important data
- Look at the work from the prior week and hold people accountable for that work
	- "We" doesn't get anything done - individuals will need to get specific tasks done
- In the strategic meeting, manage towards your hypotheses
- Where are you successful and unsuccessful?
- Not the time for feeling
	- Highly choreogrpahed
	- Predictable each week so everyone understands what is required
	- Leverage the [[Customer Relationship Manager]]
	- Data-driven, not feeling-driven
### 2.2 How to Manage Your Pipeline
- How do we do this weekly strategic pipeline review?
- **very important**: Get the meeting on the calendar and never move it
	- Hub for all things revenue generation
	- Treat it as the priority
	- 60 - 90 minutes
	- Dive into all the data
- Once you're in the meeting:
	- Start at the bottom (of the funnel).
	- Work your way up the funnel
	- 4 questions:
		- What did we do last week?
		- What did we say we would do last week?
		- What are we going to do this week and by when?
		- Problems, blockers, friction?
	- This sets the baseline
		- No anecdotes or feelings - just the data
	- Every week should be comparable to the others - we can use the data
	- Patterns
	- Only possible when the data is uniform
	- Should be able to answer the questions using the [[Customer Relationship Manager|CRM]]
		- All the information should be in the [[Customer Relationship Manager|CRM]] - if it's not there it doesn't exist
		- Don't waste time - focus on revenue generation, not data stuff
	- Identify the places where you can "hug the elephant"
		- People need to be accountable
		- Should be able to talk about the 'elephant in the room'
		- Should also be comfortable talking about any problems
	- More marketing resources towards the leads with the best probability of being closed
	- Later, this meeting will include a review of the existing customers
		- First worry about the revenue you do have, *then* about the revenue you might get
	- Money in hand > Promise of money > anything else
### 2.3 Best Practices
- Needs to be mandatory and immovable
	- Otherwise it communicates that revenue is not mandatory
	- Treat it with the seriousness that revenue deserves
- Organize the [[Customer Relationship Manager|CRM]] *before* the meeting
	- Drags the meeting on
	- Friction with the market development when some people have data and others get away with not using it
	- If the CRM is starting to fall begind, that probably means that the sales efforts are similarly falling behind
	- Poor [[Customer Relationship Manager|CRM]] hygiene is a symptom of poor market development execution
 - Accountability
	 - Everything needs a next step and an owner
	 - Don't ignore the elephant in the room when something is starting to fall apart
- Avoid rose-coloured glasses
	- Conservative with everything in the pipeline
	- E.g. probability of deals being closed
	- At the beginning you won't have much historical data to work off of; making conservative estimates mean you will be prepared if something goes wrong and encourages you to keep the foot on the gas
- Avoid vanity metrics
	- E.g. avoid a tonne of low-quality leads clogging up the works
	- No wastes of time
	- Avoid having lots of different [[Ideal Customer Profile|ICP]]s
	- Avoid stalled pipelines
		- E.g. the same people are at the same stages of teh pipeline for multiple months
		- If they haven't moved in months, they probably won't
		- Should you move on? Communicate with them
- Differentiate Process vs. People Problem
	- For the process to work, people need to be run it as designed (otherwise it's not a real test)
	- Are people doing their jobs well and on time
	- Does the process need to change or does the person need to?
	- Shouldn't be a big deal to tell someone to change - especially at the beginning, you probably won't be ideally suited to the task
	- Be realistic and contextualize the results
## 3 Customer Onboarding
### 3.1 Critical Concepts
- Lots of effort on how to get customers
- Time to shift focus towards existing customers
- Protect and grow the revenue from existing customers
- As we get customers, it gets easier to get new ones
	- New referral points
	- New market information
	- Credibility with other prospective customers
 - Where it typically goes wrong:
	 - Hand onboarding to the customer - here's a manual or something
	 - Doesn't really work at the early stages
	 - Work isn't done when the sale is completed
	 - Now you're trying to make the product as sticky as possible
	 - Good first impression, especially for the users who weren't part of the sales process
	 - References or other introductions to other customers
	 - Protect the product - put it in places where it'll succeed
	 - Should have been underpromising - time to overdeliver
	 - Identify: what's the right usecase for the technology? How should we introducce it, &c.
- Part of the market development budget will be siphoned off to existing customers
- Easier to grow revenue from an existing customer than to get it from a new one
- How to build the framework?
	- What does success look like?
	- What changes to their workflow will they see? What would make them happy?
	- You need to be setting expectations - timelines, responsibilities, &c.
	- Where is the technology failing and when us the customer not really giving it a go? What should you be doing to fix it?
- Different frameworks and tools
	- Think about how you will do the onboarding *before* you actually do it!
	- Which pieces of the template make sense for your company?
	- Should you send it or just communicate / deliver it verbally? Remember you want to be agile and iterate quickly!
 
### 3.2 Best Practices
- Don't invent something new!
	- Standard processes: **Benchmark against competitors!**
	- May be able to create a competitive advantage by improving the existing process
	- Try to reverse-engineer their onboarding process
- Over communicate
	- Communicate expectations
	- Try to do it verbally - long books / emails are not going to get read
	- Hands on with the user - make sure they have a good experience!
		- Probably they weren't part of the buying process - you should be selling the value to them!
		- Probably making their job more effective and efficient
		- Make them your friend - positive experience is key!
	- Identify the work you're creating for the customer
		- Probably they need to do something to get everything set up
		- *white glove* - make this part of the process as easy as possible
		- Strike a balance: asking for feedback and letting the customer direct the onboarding process
			- You should be the leader: don't just ask them what they want - tell them what they should be doing
			- Of course, still be open to change!
			- Reduce the cognitive load on the customer

## 4 Nurture Framework

### 4.1 Critical Concepts
- Not all deals will move with the same pace
- Laser focused on the ones that will give you revenue
- Shouldn't ignore qualified leads just because they're slow
- Long term outreach / communication strategy
- "Nurture Framework"
- 10 great opportunities:
	- Only 4 are ready to close in the next few months. Should you ignore the others?
		- No - don't let them forget about you
		- Strategy to keep people in the funnel warm
		- It's an impressions game - when something happens to make the paint point relevant, you want them to think of you
		- Need to stay in touch with them
	- When you have a slow month, you have a ready-make group of people who are at least partway through the process - perhaps a more efficient way to getting revenue
- Way of making sure that you make the most out of any conversation
- Critical to avoid cold outreach - this is a way of reducing that
- Have to become more intentional
	- E.g. need a specific nurture campaign, should be int he [[Customer Relationship Manager|CRM]], &c.
	- Need to be resourced properly
	- Manage and track the effectiveness
	- Pipeline of sequential campaigns - they should always be hearing from you in one way or another
  
### 4.2 Best Practices
- "Never say never"
	- Don't forget to follow up on "Closed-Lost" deals
	- Checking in with one you lost - how are things going with the decision they made?
		- Especially if they are early in the onboarding process
		- Be helpful and thoughtful - can you replace what they went with?
	- Good activity for a slow month
	- If you consistently do this with all of the deals that you lost, you might get a deal or something out of them
	- Worst case - they are already lost, so you can't really lose them more
	- "When's the contract term over? When's a good time for us to talk about how happy you are with COMPETITOR?"
- Educating is the most effective outreach
	- Don't be a pest
	- Educate them on the problems you solve
	- Educate them on your customers and the problems they have solved
	- Don't need to worry about a content strategy
	- Back to *impressions*
		- Should be positive!
		- "Every time they write I learn something"
- Important product updates
	- Sharing that a new feature / product just came online
	- Maybe they're looking at building this in house or opening up a new pain point / trigger event
- Don't always ask for something in return
	- Open-ended asks are OK in nurturing
	- Directed questions can be very pushy if it's on hold
	- If the content you provide is always the same, people tune it out - diversity in messaging
- Be as personal as possible (just like in Customer Acquisition Strategies)
	- Have to be following the people in your [[Ideal Customer Profile|ICP]]
	- E.g. they hire a new person that looks like a good fit, raised a round of fundraising, &c.
	- Show them that you're doing your homework
	- Good differentiator between the other stuff in their inbox
	- Organizational changes - if you see that the economic buyer has changed, that's a good trigger event
		- Good time to make a change - they probably want to shake things up!
	- Do something more to stand out from the crowd
	- When they are ready to move, you want to be the vendor that is consistently in touch and top of mind

### 4.3 Case Studies
- Company that livestreams sports for high school athletics
	- Narrow buying window (July - September) because of school budgeting situations
	- Spend the rest of the year doing nurture outreach
	- E.g. speak with someone in October, then follow the teams and send them a quick note (*not a sales pitch*) when they won
	- Lurk on the comment section about slow competitors and take screenshots about people complaining
	- Send it to the school and highlight it as an issue - make them aware of the problems, and look who has the solution...
- Company that provides tax credits as a service
	- Look for some of the smaller tax credits the companies can use
	- Prove the value of the credits
	- Creates like-like case studies
		- Every time they did the credits for e.g. a fast food company, they could email that out to the CPA and show a specific example of the tax credits they could use
	- Take the information you're learning from your clients and use that to generate new clients (make it relevant for other potential clients)

### 4.4 Exercise and Template Coaching
- Carbon copy of the Customer Acquisition Strategy template
	- That one is for the top of the pipeline; this one is for people at other stages of the pipeline
	- Need to organize the groups by level of engagement
- ![[Pasted image 20230718110549.png]]
	- Goals and hypotheses
	- Build strategies that are specific to specific groups
		- E.g. reach out to slightly different titles, different geographic areas, &c.
	- Acquisition channel: email, phone, &c.
	- Tools / resources: remember you need to protect the budget
	- Also have a launch date
	- ![[Pasted image 20230718110752.png]]
