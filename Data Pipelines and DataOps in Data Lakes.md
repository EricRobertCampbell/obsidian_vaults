## 1 Abstract
> The session includes real-world case studies and success stories, showcasing organizations that have leveraged DataOps with Databricks to streamline their data pipelines, reduce time-to-insight, and enhance data quality. We will explore practical examples of version-controlled workflows, automated testing, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, demonstrating how these practices contribute to a more efficient and reliable data ecosystem.

> The pros and cons of each example is explored.Target audience is intermediate - expert technical, but there is opportunity for learning from beginners in the world of Databricks and Datalakes. This is industry independent.
