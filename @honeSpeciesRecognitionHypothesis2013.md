## Abstract
```
The hypothesis that the exaggerated structures in various non-avialan dinosaurs (e.g. horns, crests, plates) primarily functioned in species recognition, allowing individuals of a species to recognize one another, is critically examined. While multifunctionality for many such structures is probable given extant analogues, invoking species recognition as the primary selective mechanism driving the evolution of such structures is problematic given the lack of evidence for this in extant species. Furthermore, some of the evidence presented does not support the hypothesis as claimed or is equivocal or erroneous. Suggestions that certain evolutionary patterns of diversification in these exaggerated structures are indicative of a role in species recognition are unreliable, as both a degree of phylogenetic directionality and of randomness are seen in extant species where similar structures function in sexual selection. Claims that an absence of sexual dimorphism in the exaggerated structures of non-avialan dinosaurs rule against a role in sexual selection ignores the possible existence of mutual sexual selection and is also sometimes limited in view of sample sizes. The suggestion that the existence of species recognition is supported by the presence of exaggerated structures in sympatric, closely related relatives is also erroneous because adorned dinosaur species sometimes exist in the absence of unadorned relatives. We conclude that species recognition was not the evolutionary mechanism most likely to be driving the appearance and persistence of exaggerated structures in non-avialan dinosaurs.

## Notes
- Very much a response to [[@padianEvolutionBizarreStructures2011]]
- Lack of evidence for the [[Species Recognition Hypothesis]] in any modern taxon
- In the [[@padianEvolutionBizarreStructures2011]] paper, they rejected sexual selection because of the lack of dimorphism - however, this misses the idea of mutual sexual selection, which would cause an increase in both sexes
- Also notes that [[Sexual Selection]] and [[Species Recognition]] could both be occurring at the same time and with the same strucutres
- Extinct [[Dinosauria]] probably used mutiples signals, not just one
	- Includes "zero-cost" signals like scent or colour
- In [[@padianEvolutionBizarreStructures2011]] they put froward the idea that random variation would support the [[Species Recognition Hypothesis]] rather than [[Sexual Selection]]
	- Here, they note that e.g. among [[Ceratopsia]], there is some directionality to the evolution of their frills and horns
	- Also, among extant [[Aves|birds]] there are some clearly sexually selected traits (e.g. tails of pheasants) which can be regarded as "random" (or variations on a theme)
	- Thus, this idea is not well supported
- We would expect a signal like this to to be more different among sympatric species than isolated ones; however, that is not the case
	- Has some examples of closely related [[Dinosauria]] which occurred in close proximity and have similar structures.
	- E.g. [[Oviraptor]] crests, [[Tyrannosauridae]] hornlets - both examples where there are sympatric species with similar display structures
	- Most of these structures are very costly, but for species recognition you would expect them to converge to "zero-cost"
		- You wouldn't expect this for [[Sexual Selection]] because part of the point is that the signal has to be true - it needs to be costly!
	- Also, there are a lot of these structures, even on just one species - e.g. for [[Ceratopsia]] you have the frill, the nose horn, the eye horns, &c.
		- Again, you would expect the cost to go to zero - having more than one of these seems unnecessary
	- Not clear that species recognition even needs to be a thing - in the present, lots of sympatric species complexes have no trouble recognizing member of the same species, even without any sort of exaggerated structure
- Also a challenge: varying morphologies (e.g. during ontogeny)
	- As species recognition: makes things harder (you have more to recognize)
	- As a social signal: makes sense because it visually segregates the different age groups
	- Recall that at least some [[Dinosauria]] could reproduce before reaching skeletal maturity
	- Also: at least in [[Ceratopsia]] it seems likely that young were gregarious and the adults were solitary. However, the frills, &c. were small in the juveniles and large in the adults, exactly the opposite of what you'd expect if [[Species Recognition]] was the point
