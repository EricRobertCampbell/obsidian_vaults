## 1 Summary

- Looking at the [[delta 13 C]] and [[delta 18 O]] values of various shelled organisms in the [[Western Interior Seaway]]
- Evidence is from the [[Bearpaw Formation]]

## 2 Abstract
```
δ18O and δ13C values of ammonites and inoceramids provide information on the paleoenvironmental conditions in the Western Interior Seaway (WIS) during the Campanian–Maastrichtian Bearpaw marine cycle, the last major Transgression–Regression (T–R) cycle to affect the seaway during the Cretaceous Period. Ammonites and inoceramids exhibit distinct stable-isotope values: inoceramids have higher δ13C values (0.6‰ to 5.0‰) and lower δ18O values (−4.0‰ to −2.8‰), whereas coeval baculitid ammonites have lower δ13C values (−4.8‰ to −0.3‰) and higher δ18O values (−2.3‰ to 0.0‰), with other ammonites having stable-isotope values ranging between the baculitids and inoceramids. The isotopic composition of the inoceramids and ammonites are unlikely due to kinetic or vital effects because species from open ocean environments have values expected from marine water and there is no correlation between the δ13C and δ18O values of the inceramids as has been reported for modern foraminifers and calcareous algae suspected of exerting vital effects. The heterogeneity in stable-isotope values of coeval molluscs implies that the Bearpaw Sea was isotopically stratified. Isotopic exchange between the water and sediments, and the formation of 18O-depleted deepwater mass by mixing of Tethyan and Boreal waters in the WIS, may have caused such isotopic stratification.

## 3 Notes

- Apparently you sometimes need to be careful when looking at the [[delta 13 C]] and [[delta 18 O]] values in shells because they can be precipitated out *not* in equilibrium with the surrounding seawater
- If they are *not* in equilibrium it results in a linear relation between the [[delta 13 C]] and [[delta 18 O]]
