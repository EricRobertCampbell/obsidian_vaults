## Summary

## Abstract
```

## Notes
- [[Korite Inernational]]
- Founded in 1979
- Mine [[Ammolite]]
- [[Renee Vandervelt]]
- 1981 - made an official gemstone
- 1983 - started mining it with heavy machinery
- Large [[Asia|Asian]] market
- Company went bankrupt during the pandemic
	- Restructured, &c.
- Only found in commercial quantities in about 10 square kilometres in Southern [[Alberta]]

### Ammonites
- Found around the world
- Used as proof of continental drift
- "Index fossils"
- Died out during the [[K-Pg Extinction]]

### Ammolites
- Biogenic gemstone
- Compared to [[Opal]]
- Different colours come from different thicknesses of [[Aragonite]]
- Why not in other places?
- For some reason, in southern [[Alberta]] the [[Aragonite]] stays that way instead of decomposing to [[Calcite]]
- The deposits are about 71Ma old
- Two ways to find them: searching by hand or mining
- 3 mines around the [[Milk River]] region
- [[Bearpaw Formation]]
- Different preservation in different layers
- 2 kinds of [[Ammolite]]
	- From the K Zone:
		- more fractures (like stained glass)
		- The older mines were harvesting these
	- From Zone 4:
		- Almost at the bottom of the [[Bearpaw Formation]]
		- "Sheet Ammolite"
		- Not as many fractures
		- Newer mines focus here
- Process:
	- Carefully remove thin layers of the earth
	- Search for the [[Ammolite]] by hand
	- Once you find somthing, get out and get it
	- The layers are about 4 - 4.5m thick
	- Find about 50 [[Ammonite]] per year
	- Mine in the winter (down to about -30C)
- [[Placenticeras meeki]] (about 75%)
- [[Phragmacone]]
- [[Placenticeras intercalare]] (rare)
- [[Placenticeras costatum]] (found only in Zone 4)
- [[Baculites cuneatus]] (and some [[Baculites compresus (robinsoni)]])
- Prepare them in two ways:
	- 2-sided (completly remove from the matrix)
	- In the matrix
	- The matrix is pretty much just hardened mud, so they need to stabilize it
- Donate fossils to many museums
- Lots of broken pieces / fragments
	- Cut up for jewellery
- Grading chart - based on the number and brightness of colours
- Fairly soft: 3.5
	- Put [[Quartz]] over it
- ~10% have bitemarks on them - maybe from a [[Mosasaurs]]
- Strict limits on exporting them since they're fossils
	- Every specimen needs to be run by the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology]] - they get first dibs on the specimens
	- Officially, each one is a gift from the government of [[Alberta]]
	- Certificate of Authenticity
- Also excavate and sell some dinosaur fossils
	- Typically to natural history museums
- Also found:
	- [[Mosasaurs]] (and teeth) in the same quarry
	- Found a [[Prosaurolophus]] with very good preservation
	- [[Albertonectes vanderveldei]]
	- [[Prognathodon overtoni]]
