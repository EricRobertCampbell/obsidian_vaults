The chi-squared distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and is one of the most widely used probability distributions in inferential statistics, notably in hypothesis testing and in construction of confidence intervals. This distribution is sometimes called the central chi-squared distribution, a special case of the more general noncentral chi-squared distribution. The chi-squared distribution is used in the common chi-squared tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one, the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data, and in finding the confidence interval for estimating the population standard deviation of a normal distribution from a sample standard deviation. Many other statistical tests also use this distribution, such as Friedman's analysis of variance by ranks.},

  abstract = {In statistics, a sampling distribution or finite-sample distribution is the probability distribution of a given random-sample-based statistic. If an arbitrarily large number of samples, each involving multiple observations (data points), were separately used in order to compute one value of a statistic (such as, for example, the sample mean or sample variance) for each sample, then the sampling distribution is the probability distribution of the values that the statistic takes on. In many contexts, only one sample is observed, but the sampling distribution can be found theoretically. Sampling distributions are important in statistics because they provide a major simplification en route to statistical inference. More specifically, they allow analytical considerations to be based on the probability distribution of a statistic, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all the individual sample values.},

  abstract = {The standard error (SE) of a statistic (usually an estimate of a parameter) is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution or an estimate of that standard deviation. If the statistic is the sample mean, it is called the standard error of the mean (SEM). The standard error is a key ingredient in producing confidence intervals.The sampling distribution of a mean is generated by repeated sampling from the same population and recording of the sample means obtained. This forms a distribution of different means, and this distribution has its own mean and variance. Mathematically, the variance of the sampling mean distribution obtained is equal to the variance of the population divided by the sample size. This is because as the sample size increases, sample means cluster more closely around the population mean. Therefore, the relationship between the standard error of the mean and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error of the mean equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In other words, the standard error of the mean is a measure of the dispersion of sample means around the population mean. In regression analysis, the term "standard error" refers either to the square root of the reduced chi-squared statistic or the standard error for a particular regression coefficient (as used in, say, confidence intervals).},

A summarized evaluation (applicability and acceptability) was also provided to identify the challenges and opportunities of paleontological techniques. Yet, present-day advances in molecular analyses and scanning techniques generate valuable new data to test old and recent systematic problems and provide a revolution in systematic paleontology. Integrating non-destructive high-resolution virtual solutions such as X-ray computed tomography and 3D-laser scanning with machine learning can be widely used for the analysis of internal features of fossils and more efficiently for automated taxonomy. The slow pace of the revolution in paleontological techniques can be attributed to the limited advanced statistical training and the cost of the instruments, software, and hardware needed for digitization and imaging. In addition, molecular techniques offer a unique source of information (e.g., biomarkers), however, costs and difficulties are limiting their applications. Sclerchronology using carbonate shells of well-preserved fossils (e.g., mollusks, corals, and fish) has the potential to reconstruct the paleoclimate at very high resolution (daily, seasonal, and annual). These approaches are revolutionary and will grow continuously to substitute convincing methods and will reduce time and human efforts.},

  abstract = {Einstein’s general theory of relativity from 19151 remains the most successful description of gravitation. From the 1919 solar eclipse2 to the observation of gravitational waves3, the theory has passed many crucial experimental tests. However, the evolving concepts of dark matter and dark energy illustrate that there is much to be learned about the gravitating content of the universe. Singularities in the general theory of relativity and the lack of a quantum theory of gravity suggest that our picture is incomplete. It is thus prudent to explore gravity in exotic physical systems. Antimatter was unknown to Einstein in 1915. Dirac’s theory4 appeared in 1928; the positron was observed5 in 1932. There has since been much speculation about gravity and antimatter. The theoretical consensus is that any laboratory mass must be attracted6 by the Earth, although some authors have considered the cosmological consequences if antimatter should be repelled by matter7–10. In the general theory of relativity, the weak equivalence principle (WEP) requires that all masses react identically to gravity, independent of their internal structure. Here we show that antihydrogen atoms, released from magnetic confinement in the ALPHA-g apparatus, behave in a way consistent with gravitational attraction to the Earth. Repulsive ‘antigravity’ is ruled out in this case. This experiment paves the way for precision studies of the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration between anti-atoms and the Earth to test the WEP.},

  abstract = {Endothermy underpins the ecological dominance of mammals and birds in diverse environmental settings1,2. However, it is unclear when this crucial feature emerged during mammalian evolutionary history, as most of the fossil evidence is ambiguous3–17. Here we show that this key evolutionary transition can be investigated using the morphology of the endolymph-filled semicircular ducts of the inner ear, which monitor head rotations and are essential for motor coordination, navigation and spatial awareness18–22. Increased body temperatures during the ectotherm–endotherm transition of mammal ancestors would decrease endolymph viscosity, negatively affecting semicircular duct biomechanics23,24, while simultaneously increasing behavioural activity25,26 probably required improved performance27. Morphological changes to the membranous ducts and enclosing bony canals would have been necessary to maintain optimal functionality during this transition. To track these morphofunctional changes in 56 extinct synapsid species, we developed the thermo-motility index, a proxy based on bony canal morphology. The results suggest that endothermy evolved abruptly during the Late Triassic period in Mammaliamorpha, correlated with a sharp increase in body temperature (5–9\,°C) and an expansion of aerobic and anaerobic capacities. Contrary to previous suggestions3–14, all stem mammaliamorphs were most probably ectotherms. Endothermy, as a crucial physiological characteristic, joins other distinctive mammalian features that arose during this period of climatic instability28.},

These tail clubs have widely been considered defensive adaptations wielded against predatory theropod dinosaurs. Here we argue instead that ankylosaurid tail clubs were sexually selected structures used primarily for intraspecific combat. We found pathological osteoderms (armour plates) in the holotype specimen of Zuul crurivastator, which are localized to the flanks in the hip region rather than distributed randomly across the body, consistent with injuries inflicted by lateral tail-swinging and ritualized combat. We failed to find convincing evidence for predation as a key selective pressure in the evolution of the tail club. High variation in tail club size through time, and delayed ontogenetic growth of the tail club further support the sexual selection hypothesis. There is little doubt that the tail club could have been used in defence when needed, but our results suggest that sexual selection drove the evolution of this impressive weapon. This changes the prevailing view of ankylosaurs, suggesting they were behaviorally complex animals that likely engaged in ritualized combat for social dominance as in other ornithischian dinosaurs and mammals.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are often interested in answering causal questions from observational data but generally lack the training to appropriately infer causation. When applying statistical analysis (e.g., generalized linear model) on observational data, common statistical adjustments can often lead to biased estimates between variables of interest due to processes such as confounding, overcontrol, and collider bias. To overcome these limitations, we present an overview of structural causal modeling (SCM), an emerging causal inference framework that can be used to determine cause-and-effect relationships from observational data. The SCM framework uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to visualize researchers' assumptions about the causal structure of a system or process under study. Following this, a DAG-based graphical rule known as the backdoor criterion can be applied to determine statistical adjustments (or lack thereof) required to determine causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of unobserved confounding variables, an additional rule called the frontdoor criterion can be employed to determine causal effects. Here, we use simulated ecological examples to review how the backdoor and frontdoor criteria can return accurate causal estimates between variables of interest, as well as how biases can arise when these criteria are not used. We further provide an overview of studies that have applied the SCM framework in ecology. SCM, along with its application of DAGs, has been widely used in other disciplines to make valid causal inferences from observational data. Their use in ecology holds tremendous potential for quantifying causal relationships and investigating a range of ecological questions without randomized experiments.},

  abstract = {Although the clade Crocodylomorpha is represented by few extant species (Crocodylia), it has a rich fossil record. Hundreds of species, adapted to terrestrial, semi-aquatic and marine environments, have existed over more than 200 million years. Numerous studies have attempted to characterize the factors driving the diversification and extinction events of Crocodylomorpha, resulting in ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions, which points to the need for phylogenetically and temporally smaller-scaled studies. Here, we focus on differential survival at the Cretaceous–Palaeogene (K–Pg) crisis of Notosuchia, a diverse clade of mostly terrestrial Crocodylomorpha that achieved great diversity during the Cretaceous. More precisely, we tested the effect of body size and palaeotemperatures on notosuchian survival probability during the K–Pg crisis as well as the effect of diet on the evolution of their body size. We find that Notosuchia showed an evolutionary trend towards larger body sizes through time, associated with a shift from an omnivorous to a carnivorous diet. This may explain why sebecids were the only notosuchians to survive the K–Pg crisis. We also corroborate the conclusions of previous studies that detected a Lagerstätten effect occurring in the Adamantina Formation (Upper Cretaceous, Brazil, Bauru Group). This work confirms the value of more finely-scaled macroevolutionary studies for understanding the history of a rich and complex group such as Crocodylomorpha.},

The narrow-gauge trackway is that of a large quadrupedal dinosaur. The pes is functionally tetradactyl with three rounded antero—medially directed digits, and the manus is pentadactyl. This quadrupedal form is close to Otozoum and Pseudotetrasauropus jaquesi both traditionally related to sauropodomorph trackmakers. The similarity with Otozoum is so marked that Lavinipes and Otozoum could be cogeneric. But the overall evidence today is that the Otozoum trackmaker was generally bipedal, whereas the trackmaker of L. cheminii is fully quadrupedal. The manual prints of L. cheminii show five short clawless digits and are different from the tetradactyl slender toed manual prints of Otozoum. The possible sauropodomorph affinity of the L. cheminii trackmaker is here discussed with an attempt to a revision of the Late Triassic—Jurassic tracks which have been traditionally related to sauropod and prosauropod.},

Investigation of taphonomic alteration patterns in modern cyanobacteria permits evaluation of preservation biases and decomposition timescales in the Precambrian rock record. In this study a method for assessing alteration of filamentous cyanobacteria was developed, and cyanobacterial decomposition was evaluated during short-term (days to months) experiments. Results indicate that extracellular sheaths are more likely to be preserved than are trichomes, and that rates of decomposition are variable among cyanobacterial taxa. The effects of oxygen, temperature, and desiccation on taphonomic alteration were also investigated. Desiccation of cyanobacteria produces cell shriveling, a feature that may be diagnostic of evaporitic environments. Short-term decomposition of cyanobacteria by heterotrophic bacteria under anaerobic and aerobic conditions did not produce systematically different degradation patterns; thus, alteration patterns are of limited utility for constraining the oxygen content of depositional environments. Rapid rates of decomposition suggest that in order to achieve excellent morphological preservation, heterotrophic activity must have ceased within days to weeks of deposition. These results provide constraints on the timing of lithification for comparable Precambrian lagerstätten.},

  abstract = {The Bayes factor is a ratio of two competing statistical models represented by their marginal likelihood, and is used to quantify the support for one model over the other. The models in questions can have a common set of parameters, such as a null hypothesis and an alternative, but this is not necessary; for instance, it could also be a non-linear model compared to its linear approximation. The Bayes factor can be thought of as a Bayesian analog to the likelihood-ratio test, but since it uses the (integrated) marginal likelihood instead of the maximized likelihood, both tests only coincide under simple hypotheses (e.g., two specific parameter values). Also, in contrast with null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors support evaluation of evidence in favor of a null hypothesis, rather than only allowing the null to be rejected or not rejected.Although conceptually simple, the computation of the Bayes factor can be challenging depending on the complexity of the model and the hypotheses. Since closed-form expressions of the marginal likelihood are generally not available, numerical approximations based on MCMC samples have been suggested. For certain special cases, simplified algebraic expressions can be derived; for instance, the Savage–Dickey density ratio in the case of a precise (equality constrained) hypothesis against an unrestricted alternative. Another approximation, derived by applying Laplace's method to the integrated likelihoods, is known as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); in large data sets the Bayes factor will approach the BIC as the influence of the priors wanes. In small data sets, priors generally matter and must not be improper since the Bayes factor will be undefined if either of the two integrals in its ratio is not finite.},

These include assessing sample quality relevant to ecologic, biogeographic, and evolutionary questions, diagnosing the roles of various taphonomic agents, processes and circumstances in generating the sedimentary and fossil records, and reconstructing the dynamics of organic recycling over time as a part of Earth history. Major advances over the past 15 years have occurred in understanding (1) the controls on preservation, especially the ecology and biogeochemistry of soft-tissue preservation, and the dominance of biological versus physical agents in the destruction of remains from all major taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates); (2) scales of spatial and temporal resolution, particularly the relatively minor role of out-of-habitat transport contrasted with the major effects of time-averaging; (3) quantitative compositional fidelity; that is, the degree to which different types of assemblages reflect the species composition and abundance of source faunas and floras; and (4) large-scale variations through time in preservational regimes (megabiases), caused by the evolution of new bodyplans and behavioral capabilities, and by broad-scale changes in climate, tectonics, and geochemistry of Earth surface systems. Paleobiological questions regarding major trends in biodiversity, major extinctions and recoveries, timing of cladogenesis and rates of evolution, and the role of environmental forcing in evolution all entail issues appropriate for taphonomic analysis, and a wide range of strategies are being developed to minimize the impact of sample incompleteness and bias. These include taphonomically robust metrics of paleontologic patterns, gap analysis, equalizing samples via rarefaction, inferences about preservation probability, isotaphonomic comparisons, taphonomic control taxa, and modeling of artificial fossil assemblages based on modern analogues. All of this work is yielding a more quantitative assessment of both the positive and negative aspects of paleobiological samples. Comparisons and syntheses of patterns across major groups and over a wider range of temporal and spatial scales present a challenging and exciting agenda for taphonomy in the coming decades.},

The new taxon retains plesiomorphic characters such as facultatively terrestrial limbs (plesiopedal) but also exhibits certain characters shared with derived mosasaurs of the subfamily Mosasaurinae. In phylogenetic analysis, the new taxon reconstructs as the basal member of that clade. Other plesiopedal taxa previously included in the family Aigialosauridae reconstruct in basal positions within three different, major clades that include members that achieved the derived (hydropedal) fin-like limb condition. In addition, Opetiosaurus and Aigialosaurus reconstruct as successive outgroup taxa to all other mosasauroids, thereby demonstrating the paraphyletic nature of the current concept of Aigialosauridae. Interpretation of our phylogenetic analysis suggests that three different lineages of mosasauroids independently achieved the derived mosasaur body plan, including fully marine limb modifications culminating in the development of flippers or paddle-like appendages. The inclusion of plesiopedal forms within lineages of well-established hydropedal clades requires a reorganisation of our concepts of Mosasauridae to include these basal forms. In order to avoid continued use of the paraphyletic taxon ‘Aigialosauridae’ as currently defined, we recommend ‘Aigialosauridae’ as a formal taxonomic name be used only for inclusion of Aigialosaurus dalmaticus and potential members of its own independent lineage. This also avoids the implicit polyphyletic use of ‘Mosasauridae’. Additionally, the diagnosis of Mosasauridae should be modified to exclude limb characters that discriminate between more terrestrial versus more aquatic adaptations.},

  abstract = {Sample size is a challenge for most field scientists determined not by the statistically ideal, but by the available. In vertebrate ichnology, track length is an important variable correlating well with the track-maker’s biology. It is also key to estimating the minimum number of individuals (MNI) present on a trampled horizon. Broad assumptions on biometrics of the track-makers are often made based on a few prints without consideration for intra-trackway variability. In this study we use a simple bootstrapping algorithm to explore variance within sample size for a range of trackways with fossil and experimental examples to determine the minimum sample size required to extract linear measurements. Predictably, experimentation shows that inter-step variability changes with track-maker and substrate, but the degree of variance is not as marked as previously anticipated. Change-point modelling suggests that a maximum sample size of 22–25 captures most of the variance present in track length at least; another threshold at 7–10 has been identified, which represents the reasonable sample size minimum. Samples of fewer than seven tracks are subject to large amounts of potential variance and are unlikely to provide reliable and consistent measurements. These sampling thresholds hold across a wide range of depositional environments and track-makers. We calculate generic standard errors for human track-makers which may assist the practitioner with small samples to estimate the likely errors, especially when making MNI estimates. The challenge is placed to the wider vertebrate ichnology to explore this issue for other track-makers and develop similar guidance.},

  abstract = {The sternum is a stabilizing element in the axial skeleton of most tetrapods, closely linked with the function of the pectoral girdle of the appendicular skeleton. Modern mammals have a distinctive sternum characterized by multiple ossified segments, the origins of which are poorly understood. Although the evolution of the pectoral girdle has been extensively studied in early members of the mammalian total group (Synapsida), only limited data exist for the sternum. Ancestrally, synapsids exhibit a single sternal element and previously the earliest report of a segmental sternum in non-mammalian synapsids was in the Middle Triassic cynodont Diademodon tetragonus. Here, we describe the well-preserved sternum of a gorgonopsian, a group of sabre-toothed synapsids from the Permian. It represents an ossified, multipartite element resembling the mammalian condition. This discovery pulls back the origin of the distinctive “mammalian” sternum to the base of Theriodontia, significantly extending the temporal range of this morphology. Through a review of sternal morphology across Synapsida, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of this structure. Furthermore, we explore its role in the evolution of mammalian posture, gait, and ventilation through progressive regionalization of the postcranium as well as the posteriorization of musculature associated with mammalian breathing.},

The sauropods were replaced by ornithopods as dominant herbivores, which has been explained by many ecological scenarios, including the replacement of gymnosperms by angiosperms as dominant land plants. The ornithischians went on to radiate substantially in the mid- and Late Cretaceous, with the key clades (hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, ankylosaurs) specialising in different feeding modes and diets, and reaching huge abundance in many faunas. New computational methods allow palaeobiologists to assess aspects of the palaeobiology, macroecology, and macroevolution of dinosaurs through the Cretaceous in testable and repeatable ways. These new approaches have shed light on many mysteries, such as whether dinosaurs ate flowers, why the hadrosaurs were so successful, and why some theropods became larger or smaller, or switched from carnivory to herbivory. There are further debates around the final demise of dinosaurs, where regional and global data suggest the group was in decline through the latter part of the Late Cretaceous before they were finished by the asteroid impact.},

  abstract = {This book presents a comprehensive overview of the science of the history of life. Paleobiologists bring many analytical tools to bear in interpreting the fossil record and the book introduces the latest techniques, from multivariate investigations of biogeography and biostratigraphy to engineering analysis of dinosaur skulls, and from homeobox genes to cladistics. All the well-known fossil groups are included, including microfossils and invertebrates, but an important feature is the thorough coverage of plants, vertebrates and trace fossils together with discussion of the origins of both life and the metazoans. All key related subjects are introduced, such as systematics, ecology, evolution and development, stratigraphy and their roles in understanding where life came from and how it evolved and diversified. Unique features of the book are the numerous case studies from current research that lead students to the primary literature, analytical and mathematical explanations and tools, together with associated problem sets and practical schedules for instructors and students. New to this edition  The text and figures have been updated throughout to reflect current opinion on all aspects New case studies illustrate the chapters, drawn from a broad distribution internationally Chapters on Macroevolution, Form and Function, Mass extinctions, Origin of Life, and Origin of Metazoans have been entirely rewritten to reflect substantial advances in these topics There is a new focus on careers in paleobiology},

  abstract = {Dinosaurs arose in the early Triassic in the aftermath of the~greatest mass extinction ever and became hugely successful in the Mesozoic. Their initial diversification is a classic example of a large-scale macroevolutionary change. Diversifications at such deep-time scales can now be dissected, modelled and tested. New fossils suggest that dinosaurs originated early in the Middle Triassic, during the recovery of life from the devastating Permo-Triassic mass extinction. Improvements in stratigraphic dating and a new suite of morphometric and comparative evolutionary numerical methods now allow a forensic dissection of one of the greatest turnovers in the history of life. Such studies mark a move from the narrative to the analytical in macroevolutionary research, and they allow us to begin to answer the proposal of George Gaylord Simpson, to explore adaptive radiations using numerical methods.},

Two essential elements of the hypothesis are (1) that each extinction event represents a significant departure from normal, or ‘background’, rates of extinction, and (2) that such mass extinction events are spaced equally in time. The analyses of the cyclicity of mass extinctions so far have concentrated on the past 250 Myr, with the first event occuring at the Permian–Triassic boundary, 245 Myr ago1–5. The second event followed 26–33 Myr later1–6, in the late Triassic. Here I present a detailed analysis of the fossil record of marine and non-marine life during the late Triassic which suggests that there were at least two phases of mass extinction during that time, separated by 12–17 Myr.},

  abstract = {Comparative studies of large phylogenies of living and extinct groups have shown that most biodiversity arises from a small number of highly species-rich clades. To understand biodiversity, it is important to examine the history of these clades on geological time scales. This is part of a distinct ‘phylogenetic expansion’ view of macroevolution, and contrasts with the alternative, non-phylogenetic ‘equilibrium’ approach to the history of biodiversity. The latter viewpoint focuses on density-dependent models in which all life is described by a single global-scale model, and a case is made here that this approach may be less successful at representing the shape of the evolution of life than the phylogenetic expansion approach. The terrestrial fossil record is patchy, but is adequate for coarse-scale studies of groups such as vertebrates that possess fossilizable hard parts. New methods in phylogenetic analysis, morphometrics and the study of exceptional biotas allow new approaches. Models for diversity regulation through time range from the entirely biotic to the entirely physical, with many intermediates. Tetrapod diversity has risen as a result of the expansion of ecospace, rather than niche subdivision or regional-scale endemicity resulting from continental break-up. Tetrapod communities on land have been remarkably stable and have changed only when there was a revolution in floras (such as the demise of the Carboniferous coal forests, or the Cretaceous radiation of angiosperms) or following particularly severe mass extinction events, such as that at the end of the Permian.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the methods used for estimating the parameters in Rasch Measurement Model (RMM). These include the MLE and Bayesian Estimation (BE) techniques. The accuracy and precision of the parameter estimates based on these two MLE and BE were discussed and compared. A questionnaire is a well-known measurement instrument used by most of the researchers. It is a powerful tool for collecting data in survey research. It should be noted that the quality of a measurement instrument used plays a key role in ensuring the quality of data obtained in the survey. Therefore, it has become essential for the researchers to carefully design their questionnaire so that the quality of the data obtained can be preserved. Then, it is also vital for the researchers to assess the quality of the data obtained before it can be successfully used for further analysis. Review of the literature shows that RMM is a psychometric approach widely used as an assessment tool of many measurement instruments developed in various fields of study. At present, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques were used to estimate the parameters in the RMM. In order to obtain more precise and accurate parameter estimates, a certain number of sample size and normality assumption are usually required. However, in a small sample, MLE could produce bias, imprecise and less accurate estimates with bigger standard error. A proper selection of the parameter estimation techniques to deal with small sample and non-normality of data is required to obtain more precise and accurate parameter estimates. From the review, it reveals that BE has successfully dealt with the issues of small sample and non-normality of the data. It produced a more accurate parameter estimate with smallest Mean Squared Error (MSE), particularly in a small sample compared to MLE.},

  abstract = {The extinct giant shark Otodus megalodon is the last member of the predatory megatoothed lineage and is reported from Neogene sediments from nearly all continents. The timing of the extinction of Otodus megalodon is thought to be Pliocene, although reports of Pleistocene teeth fuel speculation that Otodus megalodon may still be extant. The longevity of the Otodus lineage (Paleocene to Pliocene) and its conspicuous absence in the modern fauna begs the question: when and why did this giant shark become extinct? Addressing this question requires a densely sampled marine vertebrate fossil record in concert with a robust geochronologic framework. Many historically important basins with stacked Otodus-bearing Neogene marine vertebrate fossil assemblages lack well-sampled and well-dated lower and upper Pliocene strata (e.g., Atlantic Coastal Plain). The fossil record of California, USA, and Baja California, Mexico, provides such an ideal sequence of assemblages preserved within well-dated lithostratigraphic sequences. This study reviews all records of Otodus megalodon from post-Messinian marine strata from western North America and evaluates their reliability. All post-Zanclean Otodus megalodon occurrences from the eastern North Pacific exhibit clear evidence of reworking or lack reliable provenance; the youngest reliable records of Otodus megalodon are early Pliocene, suggesting an extinction at the early-late Pliocene boundary (∼3.6 Ma), corresponding with youngest occurrences of Otodus megalodon in Japan, the North Atlantic, and Mediterranean. This study also reevaluates a published dataset, thoroughly vetting each occurrence and justifying the geochronologic age of each, as well as excluding several dubious records. Reanalysis of the dataset using optimal linear estimation resulted in a median extinction date of 3.51 Ma, somewhat older than a previously proposed Pliocene-Pleistocene extinction date (2.6 Ma). Post-middle Miocene oceanographic changes and cooling sea surface temperature may have resulted in range fragmentation, while alongside competition with the newly evolved great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) during the Pliocene may have led to the demise of the megatoothed shark. Alternatively, these findings may also suggest a globally asynchronous extinction of Otodus megalodon.},

Using several classic examples from fisheries management, I demonstrate that selecting the model or models that produce the most accurate and precise forecast (measured by statistical scores) can sometimes lead to worse outcomes (measured by real-world objectives). This can create a forecast trap, in which the outcomes such as fish biomass or economic yield decline while the manager becomes increasingly convinced that these actions are consistent with the best models and data available. The forecast trap is not unique to this example, but a fundamental consequence of non-uniqueness of models. Existing practices promoting a broader set of models are the best way to avoid the trap.},

  abstract = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is prevalent among extant vertebrates and presumably was as common among fossil archosaurs. Here, we test the hypothesis that femur shape is a reliable indicator of sex among archosaurs using linear and geometric morphometric analyses on a large sample of sexed Alligator mississippiensis femora. Linear regression of femoral dimensions onto femur length in alligators shows that male femora are the largest and stoutest in midshaft and articular dimensions, whereas females show more variation in their midshaft dimensions. Using thin-plate splines analyses, regression of partial warps onto alligator femur length revealed that with increasing size the midshaft expands whereas shaft torsion diminishes, that femur shape differs according to sex, and that females show the maximum amount of shape variation at a size 72\% that of the largest males. However, sexual dimorphism accounts for only 3\% of the total femur shape variation in the sample. Differences in reproductive physiology (e.g, shelling eggs in females) may account for some of the fine morphological differences between males and females. However, size and individual variation appear to effect femur shape the most. These results have significant implications for inferring fossil archosaur sex from femoral dimensions and shape.},

  abstract = {Evidence for sexual dimorphism was investigated in the horncores of two ceratopsid dinosaurs, Triceratops and Centrosaurus apertus. A review of studies of sexual dimorphism in the vertebrate fossil record revealed methods that were selected for use in ceratopsids. Mountain goats, bison, and pronghorn were selected as exemplar taxa for a proof of principle study that tested the selected methods, and informed and guided the investigation of sexual dimorphism in dinosaurs. Skulls of these exemplar taxa were measured in museum collections, and methods of analysing morphological variation were tested for their ability to demonstrate sexual dimorphism in their horns and horncores. Skulls and isolated horncores of Triceratops and Centrosaurus were measured in museum collections, and analysed with the methods applied to the exemplar taxa. Considerable morphological variation was found in both species, and was suggestive of dimorphism in Centrosaurus, but was deemed not to be attributable to sexual dimorphism.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of exaggerated structures in the vertebrate fossil record has been hampered by disagreement over the definition of sexual selection and how it relates to sexual dimorphism. Previous assertions that Darwin placed a requirement of sexual dimorphism on sexual selection are mistaken. Instead, Darwin describes variation within one sex and the exertion of a struggle (expressed as intrasexual competition, intersexual mate choice, or both) as the necessary components of sexual selection. The use of structures by one sex to attract mates or repel rivals for mates occurs independently of any existing sexual differences. Differential mating success is also a requirement of Darwinian sexual selection. Mutual sexual selection is a legitimate concept that was described by Darwin. Sexual selection remains a viable explanatory hypothesis for the presence of exaggerated structures of extinct organisms and need not be dismissed summarily, but should not be employed without support as a default hypothesis. Résumé L’interprétation de structures exagérées observées chez de nombreux vertébrés fossiles a été entravée par un désaccord sur la définition de la sélection sexuelle et sur son lien avec le dimorphisme sexuel. De précédentes publications rapportant que Darwin avait affirmé que la présence d’un dimorphisme sexuel était nécessaire pour la sélection sexuelle sont dans l’erreur. En réalité, Darwin a établi que la présence de variation au sein des membres d’un sexe et l’existence d’une lutte (exprimée en termes de sélection intrasexuelle, sélection intersexuelle, ou les deux) sont les composantes nécessaires de la sélection sexuelle. L’utilisation de structures par les membres d’un sexe pour attirer des partenaires sexuels ou afin de repousser des rivaux se produit indépendamment de la présence de différences sexuelles. Pour que les effets de la sélection sexuelle darwinienne soient perceptibles, un taux différentiel du succès reproductif doit être présent. La sélection sexuelle mutuelle est un concept légitime qui a été décrit par Darwin. En conséquence, la sélection sexuelle demeure une hypothèse valable pour expliquer la présence de structures exagérées chez les organismes disparus et ne doit pas être rejetée sommairement, bien qu’elle nécessite de s’appuyer sur des éléments de preuve.},

This compulsory system helped to stabilize the industry, but its benefits were shared unevenly across the community of growers, and not all were amenable to its tenets or willing to cooperate fully with its control policies. Fruit stands were a legitimate way to circumvent the board and get paid cash for one’s produce, but they had an illicit, underground counterpart: a black market in which fruit was transported for unauthorized sale in distant population centres. Drawing on interviews with former “fruitleggers” and industry officials, this article traces the emergence, expansion, and decline of this black market, as well as Fruit Board efforts to control it.},

  abstract = {A detailed osteological description of Tyrannosaurus rex Osborn, 1905 is presented, based primarily on the most complete specimen yet collected of this taxon (FMNH PR2081, popularly known as “Sue”) but also including observations from other specimens. Skull morphology of FMNH PR2081 is largely congruent with that described for previous specimens, but new details are added. Palatal morphology of FMNH PR2081 differs slightly from that of previously-described specimens—the internal choanae are slightly larger relative to skull size, and the anterior expansion of the fused vomers is elongate. Posteriorly, the vomers pass medially for nearly the entire length of the pterygoids. High-resolution x-ray computed tomographic (CT) analysis of the skull reveals internal details not previously observed. Complex recess systems can be traced in the jugal, lacrymal, ectopterygoid, quadrate, exoccipital, supraoccipital, prootic, and basioccipital. The exoccipital recess was perforated by a small foramen on the posterodorsal surface of the paroccipital process, and may have communicated with pneumatic chambers in the atlas-axis complex. The maxillary antra were bound medially by a thin bony wall; traces of these walls in earlier CT studies of tyrannosaurid skulls may have led to the impression that these animals had bony maxillonasal turbintes. A digital endocast was constructed from these images, confirming many previous observations based on natural endocasts, but also yielding new details, such as the presence of a large and presumably pneumatic sinus in the prootic adjacent to the pathway for the maxillary-mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve. The olfactory bulbs were very large. The postcranium is also largely congruent with previously published descriptions. The precaudal vertebral column was heavily pneumatized, with pneumatopores penetrating the centra and neural arches of all presacral vertebrae, the cervical ribs, and the anteriormost four sacral centra. Unusual structures are tentatively identified as a proatlas arch and a rib on the last presacral vertebrae, structures previously thought absent from tyrannosaurids. The “missing chevron” partially responsible for claims that FMNH PR2081 is female was actually present. The gastralia are extensively fused anteriorly, and the morphology of the anteriormost gastral segments closely resembles the only published account of a tyrannosaurid sternum. This raises several possibilities, including the complete absence of a bony sternum in tyrannosaurids. The appendicular skeleton is congruent with those of other tyrannosaurids. A slender rodlike bone may represent a partial furcula, but this is not certain. The scapulocoracoids would probably not have met at the midline, but would nonetheless have closely approached each other in articulation. Several abnormalities in the skeleton have attracted popular attention. There is no defensible evidence for bite trauma on the skull, but the rib cage does show evidence for healed fractures. Lesions on the right scapulocoracoid and humerus coincide with fractured ribs on the right cervical-dorsal transition and may indicate a single trauma to the right side of the body. The left fibula is pathological, but may not have been fractured. Two fused tail vertebrae may preserve natural molds of the tail muscles.},

  abstract = {The origin of crown birds (Neornithes) remains contentious owing to conflicting divergence time hypotheses obtained from alternative sources of data. The fossil record suggests limited diversification of Neornithes in the Late Mesozoic and a substantial radiation in the aftermath of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene (K–Pg) mass extinction, approximately 66 Ma. Molecular clock studies, however, have yielded estimates for neornithine origins ranging from the Early Cretaceous (130 Ma) to less than 10 Myr before the K–Pg. We use Bayes factors to compare the fit of node ages from different molecular clock studies to an independent morphological dataset. Our results allow us to reject scenarios of crown bird origins deep in the Early Cretaceous, as well as an origin of crown birds within the last 10 Myr of the Cretaceous. The scenario best supported by our analyses is one where Neornithes originated between the Early and Late Cretaceous (               ca               100 Ma), while numerous divergences within major neoavian clades either span or postdate the K–Pg. This study affirms the importance of the K–Pg on the diversification of modern birds, and the potential of combined-evidence tip-dating analyses to illuminate recalcitrant ‘rocks versus clocks’ debates.},

  abstract = {A study of the distribution of dinosaurian body masses in the Dinosaur Park Formation (DPF; Campanian; southern Alberta), reveals a prominent negative skew; a pattern distinct from those of modern terrestrial faunas. We find a direct and robust correlation between taxon size (estimated live body mass) and known completeness. There is a clear dichotomy between large and small-bodied taxa at around 60 kg, in which taxa less than 60 kg are significantly less complete (mean completeness = 7.6\%) than those with an estimated mass of 60 kg or greater (mean = 78.2\%). Along with completeness, there is also a strong association of body size and taphonomic mode, with small taxa known largely from isolated and occasionally associated remains, and large taxa known from articulated skeletons. In addition, there is a significant correlation between taxon body mass and both date of discovery and of description, with taxa b 60 kg taking an average of 65.9 and 75.6 years to discover and describe, respectively, compared to 33.6 and 34.1 years for taxa {$>$}60 kg. The rates of both cumulative discovery and description for large taxa are best described by a logarithmic curve nearing an asymptote, whereas small taxa show either a linear or power increase through time. This suggests that our current knowledge of the large-bodied dinosaur assemblage is reasonably representative of the true biological fauna with few discoveries likely to be made in the future. However, small taxa are greatly underestimated in both their diversity and abundance, with many more potential discoveries to be made. Given that (1) the sedimentary deposits and fossil assemblages in the DPF together represent one of the best studied examples of a Mesozoic alluvial‐paralic (terrestrial) ‘palaeoecosystem,’ and (2) similar patterns have been suggested (but not documented) for other Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems in the Western Interior of North America, we suggest that this pattern of size bias may typify vertebrate fossil assemblages in terrestrial Mesozoic systems. If so, such biases must be considered before patterns of diversity in dinosaur communities through time can be considered accurate, or used to compare and interpret Mesozoic palaeoecosystems.},

  abstract = {Although the evolution and function of “exaggerated” bony projections in ornithischian dinosaurs has been subject to significant debate recently, our understanding of the structure and morphology of their epidermal keratinized coverings is greatly limited. The holotype of Borealopelta, a new nodosaurid ankylosaur, preserves osteoderms and extensive epidermal structures (dark organic residues), in anatomic position across the entire precaudal length. Contrasting previous specimens, organic epiosteodermal scales, often in the form of horn-like (keratinous) sheaths, cap and exaggerate nearly all osteoderms, allowing for morphometric and allometric analyses of both the bony osteoderms and their horny sheaths. A total of 172 osteoderms were quantified, with osteoderm spine length and height being positively allometric with respect to basal length and width. Despite tight correlations between the different measures amongst all other osteoderms, the large parascapular spines represent consistent outliers. Thickness and relative contribution of the keratinized epiosteodermal scales/sheaths varies greatly by region, ranging from 2\% to 6\% for posterior thoracics, to ∼25\% (1.3×) for the parascapular spines—similar to horn sheaths in some bovid analogues. Relative to the bony cores, the horny portions of the spines are strongly positively allometric (slope = 2.3, CI = 1.8–2.8). Strong allometric scaling, species-specific morphology, and significant keratinous extension of the cervicoscapular spines is consistent with elaboration under socio-sexual selection. This marks the first allometric analysis of ornithischian soft tissues.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific aggression, or agonism, is a widespread intrasexual selective behavior important to understanding animal behavioral ecology and reproductive systems. Such behavior can be studied either by direct observation or inferred from wound/scar frequency in extant species but is difficult to document in extinct taxa, limiting understanding of its evolution. Among extant archosaurs, crocodylians display extensive intrasexual aggression, whereas birds show extreme visual/vocal intersexual display. The evolutionary origin of this behavioral divergence, and pattern in non-avian dinosaurs, is unknown. Here we document the morphology, frequency, and ontogeny of intraspecific facial bite lesions (324 lesions) in a large sample of tyrannosaurids (202 specimens, 528 elements) to infer patterns of intraspecific aggression in non-avian theropods. Facial scars are consistent in position and orientation across tyrannosaurid species, suggesting bites were inflicted due to repeated/postured behavior. Facial scars are absent in young tyrannosaurids, first appear in immature animals (∼50\% adult skull length), are present in ∼60\% of the adult-sized specimens, and show aggressor:victim size isometry. The ontogenetic distribution of bite scars suggests agonistic behavior is associated with the onset of sexual maturity, and scar presence in approximately half the specimens may relate to a sexual pattern. Considered in a phylogenetic context, intraspecific bite marks are consistent and widely distributed in fossil and extant crocodyliforms and non-maniraptoriform theropods, suggesting a potential plesiomorphic behavior in archosaurs. Their absence in maniraptoriform theropods, including birds, may reflect a transition from boney cranial ornamentation and crocodylian-like intrasexual aggression to avian-like intersexual display with the evolution of pennaceous feathers.},

  abstract = {Ceratopsid (horned) dinosaurs are an iconic group of large-bodied, quadrupedal, herbivorous dinosaurs that evolved in the Late Cretaceous and were largely restricted to western North America [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Ceratopsids are easily recognized by their cranial ornamentation in the form of nasal and postorbital horns and frill (capped by epiossifications); these structures show high morphological disparity and also represent the largest cranial display structures known to have evolved [2, 4]. Despite their restricted occurrence in time and space, this group has one of the best fossil records within Dinosauria, showing a rapid diversification in horn and frill morphology [1]. Here a new genus and species of chasmosaurine ceratopsid is described based on a nearly complete and three-dimensionally preserved cranium recovered from the uppermost St. Mary River Formation (Maastrichtian) of southwestern Alberta. Regaliceratops peterhewsi gen. et sp. nov. exhibits many unique characters of the frill and is characterized by a large nasal horncore, small postorbital horncores, and massive parietal epiossifications. Cranial morphology, particularly the epiossifications, suggests close affinity with the late Campanian/early Maastrichian taxon Anchiceratops, as well as with the late Maastrichtian taxon Triceratops. A median epiparietal necessitates a reassessment of epiossification homology and results in a more resolved phylogeny. Most surprisingly, Regaliceratops exhibits a suite of cranial ornamentations that are superficially similar to Campanian centrosaurines, indicating both exploration of novel display morphospace in Chasmosaurinae, especially Maastrichtian forms, and convergent evolution in horn~morphology with the recently extinct Centrosaurinae. This marks the first time that evolutionary convergence in horn-like display structures~has been demonstrated between dinosaur clades, similar to those seen in fossil and extant mammals [6].},

Here, a novel method is used to measure the introduced error of multiple techniques on a representative sample. A large sample of extant crocodilian skulls was measured and analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA). Twenty-three different proportions of missing data were introduced into the data set, estimated, analyzed, and compared with the original result using Procrustes superimposition. Previous work investigating the effects of missing data input missing values randomly, a non-biological phenomenon. Here, missing data were introduced into the data set using three methodologies: purely at random, as a function of the Euclidean distance between respective measurements (simulating anatomical regions), and as a function of the portion of the sample occupied by each taxon (simulating unequal missing data in rare taxa). Gower's distance was found to be the best performing non-estimation method, and Bayesian PCA the best performing estimation method. Specimens of the taxa with small sample sizes and those most morphologically disparate had the highest estimation error. Distribution of missing data had a significant effect on the estimation error for almost all methods and proportions. Taxonomically biased missing data tended to show similar trends to random, but with higher error rates.

  abstract = {The study of dinosaurs has been experiencing a remarkable renaissance over the past few decades. Scientific understanding of dinosaur anatomy, biology, and evolution has advanced to such a degree that paleontologists often know more about 100-million-year-old dinosaurs than many species of living organisms. This book provides a contemporary review of dinosaur science intended for students, researchers, and dinosaur enthusiasts. It reviews the latest knowledge on dinosaur anatomy and phylogeny, how dinosaurs functioned as living animals, and the grand narrative of dinosaur evolution across the Mesozoic. A particular focus is on the fossil evidence and explicit methods that allow paleontologists to study dinosaurs in rigorous detail. Scientific knowledge of dinosaur biology and evolution is shifting fast, and this book aims to summarize current understanding of dinosaur science in a technical, but accessible, style, supplemented with vivid photographs and illustrations. The Topics in Paleobiology Series is published in collaboration with the Palaeontological Association, and is edited by Professor Mike Benton, University of Bristol. Books in the series provide a summary of the current state of knowledge, a trusted route into the primary literature, and will act as pointers for future directions for research. As well as volumes on individual groups, the series will also deal with topics that have a cross-cutting relevance, such as the evolution of significant ecosystems, particular key times and events in the history of life, climate change, and the application of a new techniques such as molecular palaeontology. The books are written by leading international experts and will be pitched at a level suitable for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, and researchers in both the paleontological and biological sciences.

  abstract = {The rise of archosaurs during the Triassic and Early Jurassic has been treated as a classic example of an evolutionary radiation in the fossil record. This paper reviews published studies and provides new data on archosaur lineage origination, diversity and lineage evolution, morphological disparity, rates of morphological character change, and faunal abundance during the Triassic–Early Jurassic. The fundamental archosaur lineages originated early in the Triassic, in concert with the highest rates of character change. Disparity and diversity peaked later, during the Norian, but the most significant increase in disparity occurred before maximum diversity. Archosaurs were rare components of Early–Middle Triassic faunas, but were more abundant in the Late Triassic and pre-eminent globally by the Early Jurassic. The archosaur radiation was a drawn-out event and major components such as diversity and abundance were discordant from each other. Crurotarsans (crocodile-line archosaurs) were more disparate, diverse, and abundant than avemetatarsalians (bird-line archosaurs, including dinosaurs) during the Late Triassic, but these roles were reversed in the Early Jurassic. There is no strong evidence that dinosaurs outcompeted or gradually eclipsed crurotarsans during the Late Triassic. Instead, crurotarsan diversity decreased precipitously by the end-Triassic extinction, which helped usher in the age of dinosaurian dominance.},

  abstract = {Dinosaurs were remarkably successful during the Mesozoic and one subgroup, birds, remain an important component of modern ecosystems. Although the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous has been the subject of intense debate, comparatively little attention has been given to the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, one of the most important evolutionary radiations in earth history. Our understanding of this keystone event has dramatically changed over the past 25years, thanks to an influx of new fossil discoveries, reinterpretations of long-ignored specimens, and quantitative macroevolutionary analyses that synthesize anatomical and geological data. Here we provide an overview of the first 50million years of dinosaur history, with a focus on the large-scale patterns that characterize the ascent of dinosaurs from a small, almost marginal group of reptiles in the Late Triassic to the preeminent terrestrial vertebrates of the Jurassic and Cretaceous. We provide both a biological and geological background for early dinosaur history. Dinosaurs are deeply nested among the archosaurian reptiles, diagnosed by only a small number of characters, and are subdivided into a number of major lineages. The first unequivocal dinosaurs are known from the late Carnian of South America, but the presence of their sister group in the Middle Triassic implies that dinosaurs possibly originated much earlier. The three major dinosaur lineages, theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians, are all known from the Triassic, when continents were joined into the supercontinent Pangaea and global climates were hot and arid. Although many researchers have long suggested that dinosaurs outcompeted other reptile groups during the Triassic, we argue that the ascent of dinosaurs was more of a matter of contingency and opportunism. Dinosaurs were overshadowed in most Late Triassic ecosystems by crocodile-line archosaurs and showed no signs of outcompeting their rivals. Instead, the rise of dinosaurs was a two-stage process, as dinosaurs expanded in taxonomic diversity, morphological disparity, and absolute faunal abundance only after the extinction of most crocodile-line reptiles and other groups.},

  abstract = {Synopsis Allosauroidea, a clade of large‐bodied theropod dinosaurs that ranged from the Middle Jurassic until the Late Cretaceous, has been the subject of extensive phylogenetic study. However, despite the publication of 12 cladistic analyses little phylogenetic consensus has emerged, frustrating attempts to use these dinosaurs to study character evolution, biogeography and the quality of the fossil record. Here we analyse a core subset of allosauroids using cladistic methodology and several comparative methods. After reviewing previous studies and their points of disagreement, we present a new cladistic analysis that integrates data from these studies with new characters. This analysis finds strong support for placing Sinraptor as a basal allosauroid, Neovenator as a basal member of Carcharodontosauridae and Acrocanthosaurus as a more derived member of Carcharodontosauridae, rather than the sister taxon of Allosaurus as sometimes advocated. The current dataset is compared in detail to those of previous studies to determine the degree of overlap and the basis for differing topologies. These comparisons show that scoring differences, character choice and taxonomic sampling all play a major role in generating incongruence. Finally, the recovered most parsimonious topology is used to assess character evolution, stratigraphical congruence and biogeography. This topology shows a strong overall match with the stratigraphical record and is much more congruent with stratigraphy than any alternative topology. The biogeographical history of core allosauroids is found to be congruent with the breakup sequence of Pangaea, but more complete assessment is hampered by sampling biases.},

Here, variation within 140 disassociated and seven in situ tyrannosaur teeth from the Upper Cretaceous (lower Maastrichtian) monodominant Albertosaurus sarcophagus (Theropoda: Tyrannosauridae) bonebed is documented. This sample represents the largest data set of teeth from one population of A. sarcophagus containing both adult and juvenile specimens. Tooth variation was assessed using multivariate analyses (principal component, discriminant, and canonical variate analyses). Heterodonty in the teeth of A. sarcophagus contributes to the large amount of variation in the data set. Premaxillary teeth are significantly different from maxillary and dentary teeth, but there is no quantifiable difference between a priori identified maxillary and dentary teeth. Juvenile and adult teeth of A. sarcophagus show apparent quantitative differences that are size dependent on closer investigation, suggesting a cautious approach when interpreting multivariate analyses to identify novel tooth morphologies. Multivariate analyses on teeth of A. sarcophagus and published tooth data from other North American tyrannosaurid species reveals species-level clusters with little separation. The degree of separation among tooth clusters may reveal a phylogenetic signal in tyrannosaurid teeth.},

Here, we model the diversity of "stem" (basal) and "crown" (modern) members of groups using a "birth-death model," the results of which qualitatively match many large-scale patterns seen in the fossil record. Typically, the stem group diversifies rapidly until the crown group emerges, at which point its diversity collapses, followed shortly by its extinction. Mass extinctions can disturb this pattern and create long stem groups such as the dinosaurs. Crown groups are unlikely to emerge either cryptically or just before mass extinctions, in contradiction to popular hypotheses such as the "phylogenetic fuse". The patterns revealed provide an essential context for framing ecological and evolutionary explanations for how major groups originate, and strengthen our confidence in the reliability of the fossil record.},

Here we quantify faunal cosmopolitanism using a phylogenetic network approach for 891 terrestrial vertebrate species spanning the late Permian through Early Jurassic. This key interval witnessed the Permian–Triassic and Triassic–Jurassic mass extinctions, the onset of fragmentation of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the origins of dinosaurs and many modern vertebrate groups. Our results recover significant increases in global faunal cosmopolitanism following both mass extinctions, driven mainly by new, widespread taxa, leading to homogenous ‘disaster faunas’. Cosmopolitanism subsequently declines in post-recovery communities. These shared patterns in both biotic crises suggest that mass extinctions have predictable influences on animal distribution and may shed light on biodiversity loss in extant ecosystems.},

Based on an ontogenetic series of humeral, ulnar, femoral, and tibial sections of fibrolamellar bone, we estimate the ages of the largest individuals in the sample to be between 13–19 years. Growth curve reconstruction suggests that maximum growth occurred at 15 years, when body mass increased 148 kg/year. Based on larger bones of Allosaurus, we estimate an upper age limit of between 22–28 years of age, which is similar to preliminary data for other large theropods. Both Model I and Model II regression analyses suggest that relative to the length of the femur, the lengths of the humerus, ulna, and tibia increase in length more slowly than isometry predicts. That pattern of limb scaling in Allosaurus is similar to those in other large theropods such as the tyrannosaurids. Phylogenetic optimization suggests that large theropods independently evolved reduced humeral, ulnar, and tibial lengths by a phyletic reduction in longitudinal growth relative to the femur. J.

  abstract = {The marine squamate, Dolichosaurus longicollis, from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Chalk deposits of southeast England is redescribed. The elongate neck of D. longicollis is produced by an increased number of cervical vertebrae. Cervical peduncles are elongate, curved and are not fused to the hypapophyses. There is no scapulocoracoid fenestra, the coracoid is not emarginated, and the scapula and coracoid are not fused. The splenial and angular articulate in a ball-and-socket joint similar to that of mosasaurs and Coniasaurus crassidens. The forelimb and pectoral girdle elements show evidence of reduction as compared to the pelvic girdle and rearlimb. Cladistic analysis of six mosasaur taxa, three ‘aigialosaur’ taxa, Coniasaurus crassidens, Coniasaurus gracilodens, and D. longicollis, using 66 characters, found 27 most parsimonious cladograms (MPCs): 122 steps; C.I. 0.648; H.I. 0.352; R.I. 0.669. A Strict Consensus Tree found support for the monophyly of the Mosasauridae and Aigialosauridae; sister-group relationships between coniasaurs, Dolichosaurus, Aigialosauridae and Mosasauridae are an unresolved polytomy. A Majority Rule Consensus Tree finds Dolichosaurus as sistergroup to (C. crassidens, C. gracilodens (Aigialosauridae (Mosasauridae))) in nine (33\%) of the MPCs. Lack of support for a more inclusive Dolichosauridae composed of Dolichosaurus + (C. crassidens, C. gracilodens) is attributed to the incompleteness of the fossil remains of these three taxa. Presence/absence of a pectoral girdle currently defines the presence/absence of a neck. This definition is insufficient and hypapophyses are found more informative regarding taxic differences and transformational scenarios. The paleobiology of Dolichosaurus is reconstructed as similar to coniasaurs, nothosaurs, and modern sea snakes.},

The new taxon is known from only a single specimen including a well-preserved postcranial skeleton and parts of the skull (i.e., left quadrate, left surangular-prearticular complex, and left angular and splenial). Morphological characters of the quadrate and postcranial skeleton distinguish this new taxon from other basal mosasauroids such as Aigialosaurus dalmaticus, Aigialosaurus (=Opetiosau-rus) bucchichi and Carsosaurus marchesettii. Cladistic parsimony analysis of a taxon character matrix composed of 135 characters and 31 terminal taxa resulted in the recovery of 12 equally parsimonious cladograms of 351 steps (CI = 0.48, HI = 0.52, and RI = 0.73). From these cladograms we present a phylogenetic hypothesis on the interrelationships of mosasauroids. Species assigned to Aigialosaurus form the basalmost mosasauroid clade. The new genus described here is reconstructed with Carsosaurus marchesettii in a clade that is the sistergroup to the following clade: (Haasiasaurus ((Halisaurinae, (Tethysaurus nopcsai (Yaguarasaurus columbianus, Russellosaurus coheni)) (Russellosaurina)))); the “Dallas aigialosaur,” Dallasaurus turneri, is found to be the basal-most mosasaurine. Arguments supporting the importance of pelvic evolution to the aquatic adaptations of mosasaurs are given along with a discussion of recent hypotheses of limb evolution in mosasauroids.},

  abstract = {Inferring the body mass of fossil taxa, such as non-avian dinosaurs, provides a powerful tool for interpreting physiological and ecological properties, as well as the ability to study these traits through deep time and within a macroevolutionary context. As a result, over the past 100 years a number of studies advanced methods for estimating mass in dinosaurs and other extinct taxa. These methods can be categorized into two major approaches: volumetric-density (VD) and extant-scaling (ES). The former receives the most attention in non-avian dinosaurs and advanced appreciably over the last century: from initial physical scale models to three-dimensional (3D) virtual techniques that utilize scanned data obtained from entire skeletons. The ES approach is most commonly applied to extinct members of crown clades but some equations are proposed and utilized in non-avian dinosaurs. Because both approaches share a common goal, they are often viewed in opposition to one another. However, current palaeobiological research problems are often approach specific and, therefore, the decision to utilize a VD or ES approach is largely question dependent. In general, biomechanical and physiological studies benefit from the full-body reconstruction provided through a VD approach, whereas large-scale evolutionary and ecological studies require the extensive data sets afforded by an ES approach. This study summarizes both approaches to body mass estimation in stem-group taxa, specifically non-avian dinosaurs, and provides a comparative quantitative framework to reciprocally illuminate and corroborate VD and ES approaches. The results indicate that mass estimates are largely consistent between approaches: 73\% of VD reconstructions occur within the expected 95\% prediction intervals of the ES relationship. However, almost three quarters of outliers occur below the lower 95\% prediction interval, indicating that VD mass estimates are, on average, lower than would be expected given their stylopodial circumferences. Inconsistencies (high residual and per cent prediction deviation values) are recovered to a varying degree among all major dinosaurian clades along with an overall tendency for larger deviations between approaches among small-bodied taxa. Nonetheless, our results indicate a strong corroboration between recent iterations of the VD approach based on 3D specimen scans suggesting that our current understanding of size in dinosaurs, and hence its biological correlates, has improved over time. We advance that VD and ES approaches have fundamentally (metrically) different advantages and, hence, the comparative framework used and advocated here combines the accuracy afforded by ES with the precision provided by VD and permits the rapid identification of discrepancies with the potential to open new areas of discussion.},

  abstract = {Giant carnivorous dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex and abelisaurids are characterized by highly reduced forelimbs that stand in contrast to their huge dimensions, massive skulls, and obligate bipedalism.1,2 Another group that follows this pattern, yet is still poorly known, is the Carcharodontosauridae: dominant predators that inhabited most continents during the Early Cretaceous3, 4, 5 and reached their largest sizes in Aptian-Cenomanian~times.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Despite many discoveries over the last three decades, aspects of their anatomy, especially with regard to the skull, forearm, and feet, remain poorly known. Here we report a new carcharodontosaurid, Meraxes gigas, gen. et sp. nov., based on a specimen recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Huincul Formation of northern Patagonia, Argentina. Phylogenetic analysis places Meraxes among derived Carcharodontosauridae, in a clade with other massive South American species. Meraxes preserves novel anatomical information for derived carcharodontosaurids, including an almost complete forelimb that provides evidence for convergent allometric trends in forelimb reduction among three lineages of large-bodied, megapredatory non-avian theropods, including a remarkable degree of parallelism between the latest-diverging tyrannosaurids and carcharodontosaurids. This trend, coupled with a likely lower bound on forelimb reduction, hypothesized to be about 0.4 forelimb/femur length, combined to produce this short-armed pattern in theropods. The almost complete cranium of Meraxes permits new estimates of skull length in Giganotosaurus, which is among the longest for theropods. Meraxes also provides further evidence that carchardontosaurids reached peak diversity shortly before their extinction with high rates of trait evolution in facial ornamentation possibly linked to a social signaling role.},

We also refrain from making any inferences for certain muscles where the resulting optimizations are ambiguous. This reconstruction differs from several previous attempts and we evaluate these discrepancies.

The type specimen of the purported “pygmy” tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus lancensis was compared with specimens of A. libratus and found to share many morphological characters that exemplify immature specimens of the latter taxon. Most of the cortical surface of the Cleveland skull of N. lancensis has immature bone grain. Also, the skull shares unique derived characters with mature specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex, suggesting that the specimen is a young T. rex and not a dwarf tyrannosaurid. An increase in tooth width, accompanied by loss of tooth positions, and a global shift from an immature gracile to a mature robust morphotype in the craniofacial skeleton typifies the ontogenetic changes in T. rex. Similarly, on the basis of immature characters, Maleevosaurus novojilovi is considered to be an immature Tarbosaurus bataar.},

  abstract = {Background During the growth of complex multicellular organisms, chronological age, size and morphology change together in a hierarchical and coordinated pattern. Among extinct species, the growth of Tyrannosaurus rex has received repeated attention through quantitative analyses of relative maturity and chronological age. Its growth series shows an extreme transformation from shallow skulls in juveniles to deep skulls in adults along with a reduction in tooth count, and its growth curve shows that T. rex had a high growth rate in contrast to its closest relatives. However, separately, these sets of data provide an incomplete picture of the congruence between age, size, and relative maturity in this exemplar species. The goal of this work is to analyze these data sets together using cladistic analysis to produce a single hypothesis of growth that includes all of the relevant data. Methods The three axes of growth were analyzed together using cladistic analysis, based on a data set of 1,850 morphological characters and 44 specimens. The analysis was run in TNT v.1.5 under a New Technology search followed by a Traditional search. Correlation tests were run in IBM SPSS Statistics v. 24.0.0.0. Results An initial analysis that included all of the specimens recovered 50 multiple most parsimonious ontograms a series of analyses identified 13 wildcard specimens. An analysis run without the wildcard specimens recovered a single most parsimonious tree (i.e., ontogram) of 3,053 steps. The ontogram is composed of 21 growth stages, and all but the first and third are supported by unambiguously optimized synontomorphies. T. rex ontogeny can be divided into five discrete growth categories that are diagnosed by chronological age, morphology, and, in part, size (uninformative among adults). The topology shows that the transition from shallow to deep skull shape occurred between 13 and 15 years of age, and the size of the immediate relatives of T. rex was exceeded between its 15th and 18th years. Although size and maturity are congruent among juveniles and subadults, congruence is not seen among adults; for example, one of the least mature adults (RSM 2523.8) is also the largest and most massive example of the species. The extreme number of changes at the transition between juveniles and subadults shows that the ontogeny of T. rex exhibits secondary metamorphosis, analogous to the abrupt ontogenetic changes that are seen at sexual maturity among teleosts. These results provide a point of comparison for testing the congruence between maturity and chronological age, size, and mass, as well as integrating previous work on functional morphology into a rigorous ontogenetic framework. Comparison of the growth series of T. rex with those of outgroup taxa clarifies the ontogenetic trends that were inherited from the common ancestor of Archosauriformes.},

  abstract = {The Late Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex was recently split into three species based on the premise that variation in the T. rex hypodigm is exceptional, indicating cryptic species and “robust” and “gracile” morphs. The morphs are based on proportional ratios throughout the skeleton. The species are claimed to be stratigraphically separate, with an early robust species followed by robust and gracile descendants. There are problems with the hypothesis: the taxon diagnoses are based on two features that overlap between the species; several skulls cannot be identified based on the diagnoses; proportional comparisons between Tyrannosaurus and other theropods are based on incomparable samples; the tooth data are problematic; the stratigraphic framework divides the Hell Creek Formation into thirds, without the stratigraphic position of each specimen, or independent age control showing the subdivisions are coeval over the entire geographic area; previous work found variation in T. rex, but it cannot be parsed into discrete categories. We tested for “gracile” and “robust” morphs by analyzing the femoral and tooth ratios that were published in the multiple species study using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The results found that each set of ratios are explained by one cluster, showing that dimorphism is not supported. We tested for exceptional variation of the femoral ratio of Tyrannosaurus; we calculated the mean intraspecific robusticity for 112 species of living birds and 4 nonavian theropods. The results showed that the absolute variation in Tyrannosaurus is unexceptional and it does not indicate cryptic diversity. We conclude that “T. regina” and “T. imperator” are subjective junior synonyms of T. rex.},

In concert with other anagenetic lineages of dinosaurs from the same time and place, this suggests that anagenesis could have been a widespread mechanism generating species diversity amongst dinosaurs, and perhaps beyond. We studied the excellent fossil record of the tyrannosaurid to test that hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis places this new taxon as the sister species to Daspletosaurus torosus. However, given their close phylogenetic relationship, geographic proximity, and temporal succession, where D. torosus (\textasciitilde 76.7–75.2\,Ma) precedes the younger new species (\textasciitilde 75.1–74.4\,Ma), we argue that the two forms most likely represent a single anagenetic lineage. Daspletosaurus was an important apex predator in the late Campanian dinosaur faunas of Laramidia; its absence from later units indicates it was extinct before Tyrannosaurus rex dispersed into Laramidia from Asia. In addition to its evolutionary implications, the texture of the facial bones of the new taxon, and other derived tyrannosauroids, indicates a scaly integument with high tactile sensitivity. Most significantly, the lower jaw shows evidence for neurovasculature that is also seen in birds.},

  abstract = {Background The Las Cerradicas site (Tithonian–Berriasian), Teruel, Spain, preserves at least seventeen dinosaur trackways, some of them formerly attributed to quadrupedal ornithopods, sauropods and theropods. The exposure of new track evidence allows a more detailed interpretation of the controversial tridactyl trackways as well as the modes of locomotion and taxonomic affinities of the trackmakers. Methodology/Principal Findings Detailed stratigraphic analysis reveals four different levels where footprints have been preserved in different modes. Within the tridactyl trackways, manus tracks are mainly present in a specific horizon relative to surface tracks. The presence of manus tracks is interpreted as evidence of an ornithopod trackmaker. Cross-sections produced from photogrammetric digital models show different depths of the pes and manus, suggesting covariance in loading between the forelimbs and the hindlimbs. Conclusions/Significance Several features (digital pads, length/width ratio, claw marks) of some ornithopod pes tracks from Las Cerradicas are reminiscent of theropod pedal morphology. This morphological convergence, combined with the shallow nature of the manus tracks, which reduces preservation potential, opens a new window into the interpretation of these tridactyl tracks. Thus, trackmaker assignations during the Jurassic–Cretaceous interval of purported theropod trackways may potentially represent ornithopods. Moreover, the Las Cerradicas trackways are further evidence for quadrupedalism among some basal small- to medium-sized ornithopods from this time interval.},

  abstract = {Prolific cladogenesis, adaptive radiation, species selection, key innovations, and mass extinctions are a few examples of biological phenomena that lead to differential diversification among lineages. Central to the study of differential diversification rates is the ability to distinguish chance variation from that which requires deterministic explanation. To detect diversification rate variation among lineages, we propose a number of methods that incorporate information on the topological distribution of species diversity from all internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree. These whole-tree methods (MΠ, MΣ, and MR) are explicitly connected to a null model of random diversification—the equal-rates Markov (ERM) random branching model—and an alternative model of differential diversification: MΣ is based on the product of individual nodal ERM probabilities; MR is based on the sum of individual nodal ERM probabilities, and Mσ is based on a transformation of ERM probabilities that corresponds to a formalized system that orders trees by their relative symmetry. These methods have been implemented in a freely available computer program, Symme TREE, to detect clades with variable diversification rates, thereby allowing the study of biological processes correlated with and possibly causal to shifts in diversification rate. Application of these methods to several published phylogenies demonstrates their ability to contend with relatively large, incompletely resolved trees. These topology-based methods do not require estimates of relative branch lengths, which should facilitate the analysis of phylogenies, such as supertrees, for which such data are unreliable or unavailable.},

Here we report on the discovery of medullary bone, a tissue unique to reproductively active female birds, in a specimen of C. sanctus (DNHM-D1874) lacking these feathers. Our discovery constitutes the first case of gender identification in a Mesozoic bird, and it provides undisputed evidence that individuals of C. sanctus without ornamental rectrices are females. By permitting gender identification in C. sanctus, our results provide insight into the onset of sexual maturity and attainment of adult body size of this and other early birds.},

Initial finds were made by the British North American Boundary Commission and the Geological Survey of Canada in modern Saskatchewan and Alberta but, beyond a few well-publicized examples, little is known about precisely what was found and where. Much of the collected material is now housed in the collections of the Canadian Museum of Nature in Gatineau, Quebec, and a recent survey of these historic finds allows for the first comprehensive narrative regarding their identity and procurement. The collection is heavily biased towards vertebral centra and phalanges, reflective of both taphonomic and collecting biases. Given current understanding of Upper Cretaceous assemblages of North America, ornithomimids and small theropods are overrepresented, whereas ceratopsids and ankylosaurs are underrepresented. Fossils from the Belly River Group are best represented, after repeated visits to the areas of present-day Dinosaur Provincial Park and Ross Coulee near Irvine, Alberta. Taxonomic identification of the material has yielded numerous first Canadian occurrences, in addition to some first global occurrences. The latter include the first ever occurrences of Caenagnathidae (1884) and Thescelosauridae (1889). The Upper Cretaceous fossil record of Western Canada is among the richest in the world, and has been thoroughly studied over the last century. These fossils have informed our understanding of dinosaur behaviour, taphonomy, ecology, diversity dynamics, and extinction, among other aspects. But, like the animals themselves, the story of Canada's dinosaur-hunting legacy had humble beginnings—a story that has not been fully revealed before now.},

However, despite accumulating efforts to unveil the origin of insect wings, neither hypothesis has been able to surpass the other.

  abstract = {Endothermy has evolved at least twice, in the precursors to modern mammals and birds. The most widely accepted explanation for the evolution of endothermy has been selection for enhanced aerobic capacity. We review this hypothesis in the light of advances in our understanding of ATP generation by mitochondria and muscle performance. Together with the development of isotope-based techniques for the measurement of metabolic rate in free-ranging vertebrates these have confirmed the importance of aerobic scope in the evolution of endothermy: absolute aerobic scope, ATP generation by mitochondria and muscle power output are all strongly temperature-dependent, indicating that there would have been significant improvement in whole-organism locomotor ability with a warmer body. New data on mitochondrial ATP generation and proton leak suggest that the thermal physiology of mitochondria may differ between organisms of contrasting ecology and thermal flexibility. Together with recent biophysical modelling, this strengthens the long-held view that endothermy originated in smaller, active eurythermal ectotherms living in a cool but variable thermal environment. We propose that rather than being a secondary consequence of the evolution of an enhanced aerobic scope, a warmer body was the means by which that enhanced aerobic scope was achieved. This modified hypothesis requires that the rise in metabolic rate and the insulation necessary to retain metabolic heat arose early in the lineages leading to birds and mammals. Large dinosaurs were warm, but were not endotherms, and the metabolic status of pterosaurs remains unresolved.},

Here we describe a small new polycotyline polycotylid, Unktaheela specta, gen. et sp. nov., from the Campanian of the Western Interior Seaway in North America. Because its specimens bear a host of features indicating they represent adults, Unktaheela is the smallest known adult polycotylid. Diagnostic features of the orbital region include a large orbit, a supraorbital ledge over the orbit’s anterodorsal margin, and a broad supraorbital ridge bordering the orbit’s posterodorsal rim. Other autapomorphies include an unusually short postorbital region, a uniquely wide occiput, an autapomorphic parasphenoid, unusually wide neural spines, a distinctive pubis morphology, and propodials more convex ventrally than dorsally. A new phylogenetic analysis yields a more stable polycotyline phylogeny and recovers a well-supported clade of derived polycotylines, Dolichorhynchia, clade nov. We find Dolichorhynchops herschelensis and Dolichorhynchops osborni to be united by synapomorphies not shared with other polycotylines and the only valid species of Dolichorhynchops. We erect a new genus for “Dolichorhynchops” bonneri, Martinectes, gen. nov., finding it to be united with Unktaheela and ROM 29010 by several synapomorphies not shared with Dolichorhynchops. Several plesiomorphic traits of “Dolichorhynchops” tropicensis render it basal to Dolichorhynchops and Trinacromerum, and we erect the genus Scalamagnus, gen. nov., for this taxon. Comparisons to extant tetrapods suggest that several features of Unktaheela may be adaptations for visual pursuit predation in a sunlit environment, an interpretation with ecological implications for other aquatic reptiles.},

  abstract = {Correctly classifying a species as extinct or extant is of critical importance if current rates of biodiversity loss are to be accurately quantified. Observing an extinction event is rare, so in many cases extinction status is inferred using methods based on the analysis of records of historic sighting events. The accuracy of such methods is difficult to test. However, results of recent experiments with microcosm communities suggest that the rate at which a population declines to extinction, potentially driven by varying environmental conditions, may alter one's ability accurately to infer extinction status. We tested how the rate of population decline, driven by historic environmental change, alters the accuracy of 6 commonly applied sighting-based methods used to infer extinction. We used data from small-scale experimental communities and recorded wild population extirpations. We assessed how accuracy of the different methods was affected by rate of population decline, search effort, and number of sighting events recorded. Rate of population decline and historic population size of the species affected the accuracy of inferred extinction dates; however, faster declines produced more accurate inferred dates of extinction, but only when population sizes were higher. Optimal linear estimation (OLE) offered the most reliable and robust estimates, though no single method performed best in all situations, and it may be appropriate to use a different method if information regarding historic search efforts is available. OLE provided the most accurate estimates of extinction when the number of sighting events used was {$>$}10, and future use of this method should take this into account. Data from experimental populations provide added insight into testing techniques to discern wild extirpation events. Care should be taken designing such experiments so that they mirror closely the abundance dynamics of populations affected by real-world extirpation events.

  abstract = {Mathematical methods for inferring time to extinction have been widely applied but poorly tested. Optimal linear estimation (also called the ‘Weibull’ or ‘Weibull extreme value’ model) infers time to extinction from a temporal distribution of species sightings. Previous studies have suggested optimal linear estimation provides accurate estimates of extinction time for some species; however, an in-depth test of the technique is lacking. The use of data from wild populations to gauge the error associated with estimations is often limited by very approximate estimates of the actual extinction date and poor sighting records. Microcosms provide a system in which the accuracy of estimations can be tested against known extinction dates, whilst incorporating a variety of extinction rates created by changing environmental conditions, species identity and species richness. We present the first use of experimental microcosm data to exhaustively test the accuracy of one sighting-based method of inferring time of extinction under a range of search efforts, search regimes, sighting frequencies and extinction rates. Our results show that the accuracy of optimal linear estimation can be affected by both observer-controlled parameters, such as change in search effort, and inherent features of the system, such as species identity. Whilst optimal linear estimation provides generally accurate and precise estimates, the technique is susceptible to both overestimation and underestimation of extinction date. Microcosm experiments provide a framework within which the accuracy of extinction predictors can be clearly gauged. Variables such as search effort, search regularity and species identity can significantly affect the accuracy of estimates and should be taken into account when testing extinction predictors in the future.},

  abstract = {Given the physiological limits to egg size, large-bodied non-avian dinosaurs experienced some of the most extreme shifts in size during postnatal ontogeny found in terrestrial vertebrate systems. In contrast, mammals—the other dominant vertebrate group since the Mesozoic—have less complex ontogenies. Here, we develop a model that quantifies the impact of size-specific interspecies competition on abundances of differently sized dinosaurs and mammals, taking into account the extended niche breadth realized during ontogeny among large oviparous species. Our model predicts low diversity at intermediate size classes (between approx. 1 and 1000 kg), consistent with observed diversity distributions of dinosaurs, and of Mesozoic land vertebrates in general. It also provides a mechanism—based on an understanding of different ecological and evolutionary constraints across vertebrate groups—that explains how mammals and birds, but not dinosaurs, were able to persist beyond the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) boundary, and how post-K–T mammals were able to diversify into larger size categories.},

Here we discuss optimality of estimators when the data are censored so that only the r largest or smallest of the observations are available for estimating a bound. For fixed r we find the linear function of the censored data which is the optimal estimator of a bound in the sense that, when the sample size is large, the estimator has smallest mean squared error among all such linear estimators. Even for r small, these estimators are almost optimal when the entire sample is available, since for example, when estimating an upper bound and the sample size is large, the largest few observations carry most of the information about the bound.},

  abstract = {Inferring the~size of extinct animals is fraught with danger, especially when they were much larger than their modern relatives. Such extrapolations are particularly risky when allometry is present. The extinct giant shark †Otodus megalodon is known almost exclusively from fossilised teeth. Estimates of †O. megalodon body size have been made from its teeth, using the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) as the only modern analogue. This can be problematic as the two species likely belong to different families, and the position of the †Otodus lineage within Lamniformes is unclear. Here, we infer †O. megalodon body dimensions based on anatomical measurements of five ecologically and physiologically similar extant lamniforms: Carcharodon carcharias, Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna ditropis and Lamna nasus. We first assessed for allometry in all analogues using linear regressions and geometric morphometric analyses. Finding no evidence of allometry, we made morphological extrapolations to infer body dimensions of †O. megalodon at different sizes. Our results suggest that a 16~m †O. megalodon likely had a head\,\textasciitilde\,4.65~m long, a dorsal fin\,\textasciitilde\,1.62~m tall and a tail\,\textasciitilde\,3.85~m high. Morphometric analyses further suggest that its dorsal and caudal fins were adapted for swift predatory locomotion and long-swimming periods.},

Since this initial report, the University of Alberta’s annual field work has continued to yield additional tyrannosaurid material from the Danek Bonebed. In addition to nearly 200 tyrannosaurid shed teeth, five diagnostic tyrannosaurid cranial and postcranial bones have been identified to date. Three cranial bones were included in the initial description; here the newly uncovered left and right tyrannosaurid pubes (UALVP 52709 and UALVP 56262 respectively) are described and mapped in relation to the previously known material. The pubes can be confidently diagnosed as tyrannosaurid based on a posterior bow of the pubic shaft and further classified as albertosaurine by a weakly expanded obturator plate. A. sarcophagus is the only tyrannosaurid and albertosaurine known from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which allows for the material to be confidently assigned to this taxon. The left pubis (UALVP 52709) possesses multiple tooth traces on the medial surface that were likely made post-mortem as the medial surface of the pubis would have been deep within the body cavity of the animal and reactive (healing) bone is absent. Given the numerous large gouge-like tooth traces on the medial surface of the pubis and the abundance of cf. Albertosaurus teeth from the bonebed it seems likely that an A. sarcophagus took this opportunity to feed on a conspecific; providing evidence for the first case of cannibalism from an albertosaurine.},

  abstract = {Polymorphism may play an important role in speciation because new species could originate from the distinctive morphs observed in polymorphic populations. However, much remains to be understood about the process by which morphs found new species. To detail the steps of this mode of speciation, we studied the geographic variation and evolutionary history of a throat color polymorphism that distinguishes the “rock-paper-scissors” mating strategies of the side-blotched lizard,               Uta stansburiana               . We found that the polymorphism is geographically widespread and has been maintained for millions of years. However, there are many populations with reduced numbers of throat color morphs. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the polymorphism is ancestral, but it has been independently lost eight times, often giving rise to morphologically distinct subspecies/species. Changes to the polymorphism likely involved selection because the allele for one particular male strategy, the “sneaker” morph, has been lost in all cases. Polymorphism loss was associated with accelerated evolution of male size, female size, and sexual dimorphism, which suggests that polymorphism loss can promote rapid divergence among populations and aid species formation.},

  abstract = {The Cretaceous paleocommunities of North America preserve a rich record of biodiversity that suggests many species occupied narrow biogeographic ranges in comparison to their ecological equivalents in extant systems. How taxa in these systems partitioned their niches and structured their communities can be difficult to determine from fossils alone, which has led to a variety of hypotheses concerning diets and habitat use. Here, we examine element ratios (Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) in the enamel of a suite of co-occurring vertebrate taxa sampled from a spatiotemporally constrained interval in the Oldman Formation of Alberta, Canada, to reconstruct trophic structure, and use δ13C, δ18O, and 87Sr/86Sr compositions to test for niche partitioning and habitat use among hadrosaurids, ceratopsids, and ankylosaurs. We also test previously proposed dietary hypotheses of troodontid theropods.In large ornithischians, we find Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios that are consistent with herbivory, with hadrosaurs distinct from ceratopsids and ankylosaurids in their 87Sr/86Sr ranges, a pattern that is indicative of differences in habitat use/breadth, dietary plant sources, and feeding height. The sampled mammals, varanoid lizards, dromaeosaurids, and tyrannosaurids preserve a gradient of lower Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios that is consistent with animal-dominant omnivorous to faunivorous diets. Troodontids, which have been variably hypothesized as either faunivorous, omnivorous, or herbivorous due to their distinct and unusual dentition, preserve Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios that fall between those of the ornithischians and the dromaeosaurids. From these multi-proxy data, we interpret troodontids as mixed-feeding to plant-dominant omnivores. These proxies represent a valuable tool for understanding the trophic and community ecology of Cretaceous ecosystems and hold enormous potential for future research in paleobiology.},

Skeletons of five genera of tyrannosaurids representing two distinct clades (albertosaurines and tyrannosaurines) were measured, and bivariate analysis was done on 85 dimensions. Allometric differences among mature specimens of different species are shown to be trivial when compared with the allometric differences associated with growth. Nevertheless, albertosaurines tend to be more lightly built than tyrannosaurines. When compared with a tyrannosaurine of the same absolute size, albertosaurines had slightly shorter, lower skulls, shorter ilia, longer tibiae, longer metatarsals, and longer toes. The arms of albertosaurines and tyrannosaurines are the same size, with the exception of Tarbosaurus, which has shorter front limb elements. Tooth counts show individual and interspecific variation, but there is no evidence that tooth numbers are controlled by the size or age of an animal. Dinotyrannus, Jenghizkhan, Maleevosaurus, Shanshanosaurus, Stygivenator, and possibly Nanotyrannus have proportions that suggest they are ontogenetic stages of either Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.},

  abstract = {Beautifully preserved, nearly complete theropod skeletons from Alberta (Canada) allow re−evaluation of the taxonomic status of North American tyrannosaurids. It is concluded that the most parsimonious interpretation of relationships leads to the separation of the two species of Albertosaurus (sensu Russell 1970) into Gorgosaurus libratus from the Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation and Albertosaurus sarcophagus from the upper Campanian/lower Maastrichtian Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus are closely related, but can be distinguished from each other by more characters than are known to justify generic distinction within another tyrannosaurid clade that includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Daspletosaurus is known from multiple species that cover extensive geographic, eco− logical and temporal ranges, and it is sensible to maintain its generic distinction from Tyrannosaurus. All tyrannosaurid species have consistent ontogenetic trends. However, one needs to be cautious in assessing ontogenetic stage because many characters are size−dependent rather than age−dependent. There are relatively few osteological differences that can distinguish tyrannosaurid species at any age. For example, Nanotyrannus lancensis is probably a distinct species from Tyrannosaurus rex because there is no evidence of ontogenetic reduction of tooth counts in any other tyrannosaurid spe− cies. Some characters that are good for separating mature tyrannosaurids, such as differences in the sizes and shapes of maxillary fenestrae, are not useful for identifying the species of juveniles.},

Colossosuchus is diagnosed by multiple apomorphies, including a strongly downturned terminal rosette (c. 70°), closely spaced mediolateral band-like ornamentation on dorsal surface of the nasal, dorsolaterally oriented supratemporal fenestra, ventrolaterally inclined postorbital–squamosal bars depressed below the skull table, dorsally convex parietal–squamosal bar that descends ventrolaterally below the skull roof, dome-shaped skull in lateral view, prominent neural arch laminae and fossae, three sacral vertebrae, robust proximal end of the tibia, and fibula with high anteroposterior flaring of the distal end. The total body length of the largest individual recovered from the bonebed is estimated to be more than 8 m, suggesting that Colossosuchus is one of the largest phytosaurs known. Phylogenetic analysis nests Colossosuchus and other undescribed specimens from India within Mystriosuchinae. These form a distinct clade and represent the earliest record of endemism among Gondwanan phytosaurs. This clade is recovered as sister taxa to ((Volcanosuchus + Rutiodon) + Leptosuchomorpha), where the depressed supratemporal fenestra first appeared in the phytosaur lineage, a feature previously used to diagnose the derived leptosuchomorphs. Early-diverging phytosaur diversification may have coincided with the final stages of the Carnian Pluvial Event with their possible migratory routes along the circum-Tethyan coastline. The lineage continued to evolve mostly through endemic radiations and experienced an extinction event during early Norian, which marked the disappearance of most of the non-leptosuchomorph taxa. This is attributed to post-CPE aridification, although more study is required.},

Here, we test between two key factors that potentially influence ecological severity: biosphere entropy (a measure of functional redundancy), and the degree of functional selectivity (in terms of deviation from a pattern of random extinction with respect to functional entities). While theoretical simulations suggest that the Shannon entropy of a given community prior to an extinction event determines the expected outcome following a perturbation of a given magnitude, actual variation in Shannon entropy between major extinction intervals is insufficient to explain the observed variation in ecological severity. Within this information-theoretic framework, we show that it is the degree of functional selectivity that is expected to primarily determine the ecological impact of a given perturbation when levels of functional redundancy are not substantially different.},

Despite—or even spurred by—this growing availability of resources, analytical paleobiology faces deep-rooted obstacles that stem from the need for more equitable access to data and best practices to guide analyses of the fossil record. Recent progress has been accelerated by a collective push toward more collaborative, interdisciplinary, and open science, especially by early-career researchers. Here, we survey four challenges facing analytical paleobiology from an early-career perspective: (1) accounting for biases when interpreting the fossil record; (2) integrating fossil and modern biodiversity data; (3) building data science skills; and (4) increasing data accessibility and equity. We discuss recent efforts to address each challenge, highlight persisting barriers, and identify tools that have advanced analytical work. Given the inherent linkages between these challenges, we encourage discourse across disciplines to find common solutions. We also affirm the need for systemic changes that reevaluate how we conduct and share paleobiological research.},

Yet, the field is still attempting to form an identity distinct from its academic roots. Here, we ask a deceptively simple question: What is conservation paleobiology? To track its development as a field, we synthesize complementary perspectives from a survey of the scientific community that is familiar with conservation paleobiology and a systematic literature review of publications that use the term. We present an overview of conservation paleobiology’s research scope and compare survey participants’ perceptions of what it is and what it should be as a field. We find that conservation paleobiologists use a variety of geohistorical data in their work, although research is typified by near-time records of marine molluscs and terrestrial mammals collected over local to regional spatial scales. Our results also confirm the field’s broad disciplinary basis: survey participants indicated that conservation paleobiology can incorporate information from a wide range of disciplines spanning conservation biology, ecology, historical ecology, paleontology, and archaeology. Finally, we show that conservation paleobiologists have yet to reach a consensus on how applied the field should be in practice. The survey revealed that many participants thought the field should be more applied but that most do not currently engage with conservation practice. Reflecting on how conservation paleobiology has developed over the last two decades, we discuss opportunities to promote community cohesion, strengthen collaborations within conservation science, and align training priorities with the field’s identity as it continues to crystallize.},

Characters of the frill are found to be very variable, and ontogenetic changes in the arrangement of the adductor muscles presumed to originate from it cannot be interpreted as improving or even maintaining the functional constancy of the masticatory system. A definitive determination of sexual dimorphism was permitted by principal coordinates analysis, and measurements of the frill play a prominent part in the dimorphism, verifying that in its development the frill has considerably more significance than simply serving as a site of origin of masticatory muscles.

  abstract = {The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation has yielded one of the richest dinosaur faunas of the world. Morrison sediments are distributed over more than a million square kilometers in the western United States and represent a mosaic of riverine, lacustrine and floodplain environments developed on a vast alluvial plain nourished by debris from the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Plant productivity must have been reasonably high to support abundant large-bodied herbivores, but the absence of coals, scarcity of small aquatic vertebrates, the abundance of oxidized sediments, and presence of calcretes lead us to believe that water was periodically in short supply. A strongly seasonal climate may have necessitated annual large-scale movements of large herbivores, accounting in part for their remarkably broad and uniform geographic distribution. Dinosaur diversity is lower in the Morrison than in the Late Cretaceous, and taphonomic alteration is higher. Massed accumulations of thousands of bones are characteristic of the Morrison. Morrison dinosaurs were not confined to specific depositional environments but were distributed across the complete spectrum of available habitats, from lakes to dry floodplains; this type of distribution is similar to that of large terrestrial mammals such as elephants and rhinos and is different from that of hippos and crocodiles. Common Morrison taxa were Camarasaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Allosaurus and Stegosaurus; these genera probably constituted a true dinosaur community. Stegosaurus may have been partially segregated from the other genera, and Camptosaurus more strongly so. Camarasaurus and Diplodocus were gregarious, with juveniles and subadults of the former particularly common; Apatosaurus was less abundant and more solitary in its habits. Juveniles and subadults are known for a number of dinosaurs.},

Through a series of course syllabi analyses, we explored the topics covered and their popularity in these courses, and the adopted teaching and learning tools, such as software. This article presents our findings on the current practices of teaching full Bayesian courses at the undergraduate level.

  abstract = {Bite marks provide direct evidence for trophic interactions and competition in the fossil record. However, variations in paleoecological dynamics, such as trophic relationships, feeding behavior, and food availability, govern the frequency of these traces. Theropod bite marks are particularly rare, suggesting that members of this clade might not often focus on bone as a resource, instead preferentially targeting softer tissues. Here, we present an unusually large sample of theropod bite marks from the Upper Jurassic Mygatt-Moore Quarry (MMQ). We surveyed 2,368 vertebrate fossils from MMQ in this analysis, with 684 specimens (28.885\% of the sample) preserving at least one theropod bite mark. This is substantially higher than in other dinosaur-dominated assemblages, including contemporaneous localities from the Morrison Formation. Observed bite marks include punctures, scores, furrows, pits, and striations. Striated marks are particularly useful, diagnostic traces generated by the denticles of ziphodont teeth, because the spacing of these features can be used to provide minimum estimates of trace maker size. In the MMQ assemblage, most of the striations are consistent with denticles of the two largest predators known from the site: Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus. One of the bite marks suggests that a substantially larger theropod was possibly present at the site and are consistent with large theropods known from other Morrison Formation assemblages (either an unusually large Allosaurus or a separate, large-bodied taxon such as Saurophaganax or Torvosaurus). The distribution of the bite marks on skeletal elements, particularly those found on other theropods, suggest that they potentially preserve evidence of scavenging, rather than active predation. Given the relative abundances of the MMQ carnivores, partnered with the size-estimates based on the striated bite marks, the feeding trace assemblage likely preserves the first evidence of cannibalism in Allosaurus.},

This morphology contrasts with their sister group, Hadrosaurinae, which possessed the plesiomorphic arrangement of bones. Although studies have discussed differences between lambeosaurine and hadrosaurine skull morphology and ontogeny, there is little information detailing suture modifications through ontogeny and evolution. Suture morphology is of particular interest due to its correlation with the mechanical loading of the skull in extant vertebrates. We quantify and contrast the morphology of calvarial sutures in iguanodontians and ontogenetic series of Corythosaurus and Gryposaurus to test whether the evolution of lambeosaurine crests impacted the mechanical loading of the skull. We found that suture interdigitation (SI) increases through ontogeny in hadrosaurids, although this increase is more extreme in Corythosaurus than Gryposaurus, and overall suture complexity (i.e., overall shape) remained constant. Lambeosaurines also have higher SI than other iguanodontians, even in crestless juveniles, suggesting that increased sinuosity is unrelated to the structural support of the crest. Hadrosaurines and basal iguanodontians did not differ. Similarly, lambeosaurines have more complexly shaped sutures than hadrosaurines and basal iguanodontians, while the latter two groups do not differ. Taken together, these results suggest that lambeosaurine calvarial sutures are more interdigitated than other iguanodontians, and although suture sinuosity increased through ontogeny, the suture shape remained constant. These ontogenetic and evolutionary patterns suggest that increased suture complexity in lambeosaurines coincided with crest evolution, and corresponding modifications to their facial skeleton altered the distribution of stress while feeding.},

While the taxonomic status of aigialosaurs has changed little in the past century, the interfamilial relationships have been modified considerably making the phylogenetic relationships between aigialosaurs, mosasaurs, dolichosaurs, coniasaurs, varanids and other squamates a topic of much debate. The monophyly of the family Aigialosauridae has been contested by recent studies and remains highly questionable. The higher-level relationships of mosasauroids within Squamata remain problematic with studies placing mosasauroids outside of Varanidae, Varanoidea and even Anguimorpha. These findings conflict with earlier views that aigialosaurs (and by association mosasaurs) were closely related to Varanus. This study concludes that further descriptions of aigialosaur taxa are needed, and several key flaws need to be addressed in the data matrices that have been used in previous studies. This should facilitate the clarification of aigialosaur systematic relationships both within Mosasauroidea and Squamata.},

  abstract = {The Atlantic Sharpnose Shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson, 1836), is the most common small coastal requiem shark in the north-central Gulf of Mexico, USA. Despite this fact, little is known about the dental variation within this taxon. To help rectify this shortcoming, we examined 126 male and female R. terraenovae jaws sets across all maturity stages to document the various types of heterodonty occurring in the dentition of this taxon. Quantitative data gathered from a subset of our sample allowed for us to place teeth within the dentition of R. terraenovae into standardized upper and lower parasymphyseal/symphyseal, anterior lateral, and posterior tooth groups. As with all carcharhinid sharks, the dentition of R. terraenovae exhibits monognathic and dignathic heterodonty. We also observed significant ontogenetic heterodonty in the species, as the teeth and dentition progress through five generalized developmental stages as the shark matures. The ontogenetic development of serrations on the teeth appears to be closely related to documented dietary changes as the shark matures. Initial diets are comprised of high percentages of invertebrate prey like shrimp, crabs, and squid, but this transitions through ontogeny to a diet that is more reliant on fishes. We also provide the first documentation of gynandric heterodonty in mature male R. terraenovae, with development of these seasonal teeth likely enabling a male to grasp female sharks during copulation. Our analysis revealed a tremendous amount of variation in the dentition of R. terraenovae, which has direct implications on the taxonomy of fossil Rhizoprionodon. A comparison of the jaws in our sample to those of the extant species of Rhizoprionodon and the morphologically similar Loxodon, Scoliodon, and Sphyrna allowed us to formulate a list of generic-level characteristics to assist with the identification of isolated teeth. When applied to the fossil record, it is shown that some species previously assigned to Rhizoprionodon likely belong to one of the other aforementioned genera. The earliest occurrence of unequivocal Rhizoprionodon teeth in the fossil record are those of the Eocene †R. ganntourensis (Arambourg, 1952), the oldest records of which occur in early Ypresian deposits in Alabama and Mississippi, USA. The early Eocene occurrence of unequivocal fossil Rhizoprionodon teeth in Alabama predates the first occurrence of Negaprion, Galeocerdo, and Carcharhinus teeth in the state, supporting published molecular and morphological phylogenies positing a basal position for Rhizoprionodon within the Carcharhinidae.},

  abstract = {The 100\,m thick stratigraphic section exposed at Dinosaur Provincial Park (DPP; southern Alberta) contains bentonites that have been used for more than 30 years to date DPP’s rocks and fossils using the K–Ar decay scheme. Limited reproducibility among different vintages of K–Ar and 40Ar/39Ar ages inhibited the development of a high-resolution chronostratigraphy. Here, we employ and further test a recently completed U–Pb geochronology and associated age-stratigraphy model to update temporal constraints on the Park’s bentonites, formational contacts, and other markers. In turn, we document rock accumulation rates and calibrate ages and durations of informal megaherbivore dinosaur assemblage zones and other biozones. Weighted mean 206~Pb/238~U ages from five bentonites range from 76.718\,±\,0.020 to 74.289\,±\,0.014\,Ma (2σ internal uncertainties) through an interval of 88.75\,m, indicating a duration of ∼2.43\,Myr and an overall rock accumulation rate of 3.65\,±\,0.04\,cm/ka. An increase in rate above the Oldman–Dinosaur Park formational contact conforms to a regionally expressed pattern of increased accommodation at ∼76.3\,Ma across Alberta and Montana. Palynological biozone data suggest a condensed section/hiatus in the uppermost portion of the Oldman Formation. Dinosaur assemblage zones exhibit durations of ∼700–600\,kyr and are significantly shorter than those in the overlying Horseshoe Canyon Formation. A decreased rate in dinosaur assemblage turnovers in the last eight million years of the Mesozoic in western Canada may be explained by withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway and the expansion of ecologically homogenous lowlands in its wake.},

  abstract = {A high-resolution biostratigraphic analysis of 287 dinosaurian macrofossils and 138 bonebeds in the Edmonton Group (Upper Cretaceous) of southern Alberta provides evidence for at least three dinosaurian assemblage zones in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (HCFm). From bottom to top the zones comprise unique assemblages of ornithischians and are named as follows: 1) Edmontosaurus regalis-Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis (lower zone); 2) Hypacrosaurus altispinus-Saurolophus osborni (middle zone); and 3) Eotriceratops xerinsularis (upper zone). Whereas the lower and middle zones are well-defined and based on abundant specimens, the validity of the uppermost zone (E. xerinsularis) is tentative because it is based on a single specimen and the absence of dinosaur taxa from lower in section. The transition from the lower to the middle zone coincides with the replacement of a warm-and-wet saturated deltaic setting by a cooler, coastal-plain landscape, characterized by seasonal rainfall and better-drained substrates. Whereas changes in rainfall and substrate drainage appear to have influenced the faunal change, changes in mean annual temperature and proximity to shoreline appear to have had little influence on faunal change. We speculate that the faunal change between the middle and upper zones also resulted from a change in climate, with ornithischian dinosaurs responding to the re-establishment of wetter-and-warmer climates and poorly-drained substrates. Compared with the shorter-duration and climaticallyconsistent dinosaurian assemblage zones in the older Dinosaur Park Formation of southern Alberta, HCFm assemblage zones record long-term morphological stasis in dinosaurs. Furthermore, the coincidence of faunal and paleoenvironmental changes in the HCFm suggest climate-change-driven dinosaur migrations into and out of the region.},

This subdivision, based on combined outcrop and subsurface analyses, reflects lithostratigraphic variations related to changes in sea level (previously recognized) and newly documented changes in climate, volcanism, and orogenesis in an evolving foreland basin. Million-year-scale cycles of orogenesis resulted in changes in sediment supply and rates of subsidence in the basin and are interpreted in the context of a simple, two-phase foreland-basin sequence stratigraphic model: (i) overthrust loading resulting in reduced rates of sediment supply and subsidence in the most distal portions of the Alberta foredeep (our field area); (ii) tectonic quiescence leading to increased rates of sediment supply and subsidence during proximal-foredeep rebound. During the first ∼2.5 Ma of its history (Strathmore and Drumheller members), the HCFm was tectonically and climatically “stable”, and depositional style and stratigraphic architecture were influenced by vertical aggradation and modest progradation of shorelines. During the remaining ∼4.5 Ma (Horsethief, Morrin, Tolman, Carbon, and Whitemud members), there were more complex and frequent changes in climate, volcanism, orogenesis, landscape weathering, and soil formation. Understanding this previously unrecognized complexity is critical for correctly assessing hydrocarbon resource distributions and biostratigraphic and taphonomic patterns.},

  abstract = {The Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Belly River Group (BRG) of southern Alberta has a complex internal stratigraphic architecture derived from differential geometries of its component formations that resulted from regionalized tectonic influences and shifting source areas. A full understanding of BRG architecture has been compromised heretofore by a limited understanding of subsurface data in southwestern- and southeastern-most Alberta. In this study outcrop exposures throughout southern Alberta are tied to reference well logs and subsurface cross-sections allowing a more precise understanding of BRG architecture and how it relates to well-known vertebrate fossil producing areas. Modifications to an existing stratigraphic model of the BRG show that the Oldman and the Dinosaur Park formations have reciprocal north-to-south wedge-shaped geometries and a diachronous contact that become prominently expressed south of Twp 12. The updated model also demonstrates that the Oldman Formation thickens stratigraphically up-section to the south, and that the Foremost-Oldman contact is, essentially, a datum across much of southern Alberta. Identification of the Oldman Formation in the subsurface remains based on its relatively high gamma-ray response in mudstone successions, but it is also recognized that many of its sandstones exhibit relatively low gamma-ray responses like those in underlying and overlying formations. Nomenclature and subdivisions of the Oldman Formation are revised to accommodate this updated understanding, and modifications are also made to the definition of the Judith River-Belly River discontinuity, a newly recognized surface that marks the onset of accommodation and eustatic rise in sea-level in the northern Western Interior Basin at \textasciitilde 76.3 Ma.},

  abstract = {Although considerable work has been conducted on the stratigraphy and dinosaur assemblages of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of southern Alberta, equivalent strata and assemblages in central Alberta remain poorly understood. Data from the Danek Bonebed (Edmonton, Alberta) are beginning to fill this gap. The bonebed occurs 4 m above the \#9 Big Island Coal Seam. This stratigraphic position lies just below the middle of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in the Edmonton region, and also lies below a thick, stratigraphically significant non-coaly interval that is expressed throughout central and southern Alberta. The stratigraphic position of the Danek Bonebed equates best with the uppermost Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in the Drumheller region and the upper part of Unit 4 of the Wapiti Formation in the Grande Prairie region. In both Drumheller and Grande Prairie, the correlated position of the bonebed underlies a zone of marine transgression (Drumheller Marine Tongue), which, in turn, includes the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary. In the context of Geologic Time Scale 2004, we infer a late Campanian age of 71.0–71.3 Ma for the bonebed. The Danek’s dinosaurian assemblage is limited taxonomically, but compares well with the Edmontosaurus regalis – Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis fossil assemblage zone in the Drumheller region. We propose that a mega-herbivore faunal assemblage, characterized by Edmontosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, extended continuously across the climatically wet coastal plain of latest Campanian southern and central Alberta, and likely extended northwest into the North Slope of Alaska, where it persisted into the early Maastrichtian.},

Albertosaurus, other vertebrates, and trees are concentrated on upper point bar surfaces of a small meandering paleochannel. Throughout the field area, Albertosaurus, other vertebrates, and coalified plants are also preserved patchily in overbank mudstones at the same horizon. Although the bonebed is dominated by Albertosaurus, there are also sparse macrofossil remains of Hypacrosaurus and Albertonykus. The basal lag yields vertebrate microfossils containing at least 19 additional taxa. Freshwater invertebrates are preserved at and below the base of the paleochannel. Large elements are over represented at the site, whereas smaller elements are under represented, suggesting hydraulic sorting. The taphonomic signature of the site suggests that death, disarticulation, and burial took place within one year. We conclude that one or more storms of large intensity downed trees and temporarily drowned the paleolandscape, ultimately killing the tyrannosaurids directly or indirectly. Logs and carcasses were reworked on a point bar during the waning stages of the storm and over subsequent years. Scavenging and breakage of remains by large carnivores was probably inhibited by the mixed log and bone jam. Remains of smaller scavengers (small theropods and snails) are plentiful suggesting these forms were more successful at accessing remains. Juvenile Albertosaurus are under represented at the site suggesting the possibility of age segregation. Because the group of Albertosaurus may have been forced together by rising floodwaters, it is not possible to assess the degree to which the taxon was gregarious from these data alone.},

  abstract = {Dunkleosteus terrelli, an arthrodire placoderm, is one of the most widely recognized fossil vertebrates due to its large size and status as one of the earliest vertebrate apex predators. However, the exact size of this taxon is unclear due to its head and thoracic armor being the only elements of its body regularly preserved in the fossil record. Lengths of 5–10 m are commonly cited, but these estimates are not based on rigorous statistical analysis. Here, I estimate the body size of D. terrelli using a new metric, orbit-opercular length, and a large dataset of arthrodires and extant fishes (3169 observations, 972 species). Orbit-opercular length strongly correlates with total length in fishes (r2 = 0.947, PEcf = 17.55\%), and accurately predicts body size in arthrodires known from complete remains. Applying this method to Dunkleosteus terrelli results in much smaller sizes than previous studies: 3.4 m for typical adults (CMNH 5768) with the largest known individuals (CMNH 5936) reaching \textasciitilde 4.1 m. Arthrodires have a short, deep, and cylindrical body plan, distinctly different from either actinopterygians or elasmobranchs. Large arthrodires (Dunkleosteus, Titanichthys) were much smaller than previously thought and vertebrates likely did not reach sizes of 5 m or greater until the Carboniferous.},

  abstract = {The sex of non-avian dinosaurs has been inferred on numerous occasions using a variety of anatomical criteria, but the efficacy of none has been proven. Nearly 50 years ago Romer suggested that the cranial-most or first chevron in the tails of some reptiles, including crocodilians, is sexually dimorphic. Recent work on this subject purportedly substantiated that the female first chevron articulates in a more caudal position than in males. Furthermore, it was concluded that this element is shorter in females. These phenotypic attributes theoretically provide a broader cloacal passageway for eggs by ovipositing females and a greater attachment area for male “penile retractor muscles”. Because theropod dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus rex presumably show similar variation in chevron anatomy, the same criteria has been advocated for sexing dinosaurs. We tested the neontological model for the chevron sexual dimorphism hypothesis using a skeletonized growth series of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) of known sex. No statistical support for the hypothesis was found. Furthermore, analysis of a diversity of crocodilian taxa from museum collections revealed similar findings suggesting the alligator results are not taxon specific. Study of well-preserved tyrannosaurid dinosaurs in museum collections showed nearly invariant chevron positioning like that seen in crocodilians. This suggests the usefulness of chevron anatomy for sexing dinosaurs is tenuous.},

Analyses of these data in an evolutionary context are enabling the identification of developmental patterns that lead to size changes within the Dinosauria. Furthermore, this rich new database is providing inroads for studying individual and population biology.

From such data it is now understood that dinosaurs grew both disruptively and determinately; that they rarely if ever exceeded a century in age; that they became giants through accelerated growth and dwarfed through truncated development; that they were likely endothermic, sexually matured like crocodiles, and showed survivorship like populations of large mammals; and that basal birds retained dinosaurian physiology.},

  abstract = {How evolutionary changes in body size are brought about by variance in developmental timing and/or growth rates (also known as heterochrony) is a topic of considerable interest in evolutionary biology1. In particular, extreme size change leading to gigantism occurred within the dinosaurs on multiple occasions2. Whether this change was brought about by accelerated growth, delayed maturity or a combination of both processes is unknown. A better understanding of relationships between non-avian dinosaur groups and the newfound capacity to reconstruct their growth curves make it possible to address these questions quantitatively3. Here we study growth patterns within the Tyrannosauridae, the best known group of large carnivorous dinosaurs, and determine the developmental means by which Tyrannosaurus rex, weighing 5,000\,kg and more, grew to be one of the most enormous terrestrial carnivorous animals ever. T. rex had a maximal growth rate of 2.1\,kg\,d-1, reached skeletal maturity in two decades and lived for up to 28 years. T. rex's great stature was primarily attained by accelerating growth rates beyond that of its closest relatives.},

How Deinosuchus attained sizes to rival its dinosaurian contemporaries, on which it undoubtedly preyed, has remained a mystery. Did it exhibit accelerated growth rates, like its dinosaurian cousins1, or did it simply maintain primitive reptilian rates for decades (as was once proposed to explain gigantism in dinosaurs2)? We find that growth indices from Deinosuchus skeletons reveal rates comparable to those of smaller crocodylian taxa, indicating that the gigantic proportions were attained by prolonging development.},

Multi-individual sampling and longevity estimation using growth line counts can be used to construct life tables—the foundation for population analyses in ecology. Here we have determined the size and age distribution for a sample consisting of 80 individuals of the small ornithischian, Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis from the early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China. Their ages ranged from less than a year to eleven years and the distribution was strongly right-skewed. This is consistent with taphonomic interpretations that these animals derive from a catastrophic death assemblage. The static life table analysis revealed the same general pattern of survivorship as tyrannosaurs including increased attrition before the attainment of full adult size. This may reflect increased physiological demands and/or predation exposure associated with reproduction. Collectively these findings suggest that most nonavian dinosaurs may have had a similar life history strategy. Anat Rec, 292:1514–1521, 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We sought marker-based, osteohistological evidence for ceratopsid age structure from high Arctic paleolatitudes based on the observations that: (1) extant mammals from high latitudes better express growth lines in their hard tissues than those from lower latitudes, and (2) the occurrence of accentuated growth banding in teeth from Arctic dinosaurs. We examined the long bones in the specimens of Pachyrhinosaurus sp. from the early Maastrichtian of northern Alaska, and found conspicuous osseous banding. Histological analysis of the spacing, structure, pattern and numbers of these bands in the femur of a very large specimen suggests that they are not a taphonomic artefact, rather they appear to reflect annual growth cycling. Counts and measurements of the growth zones suggest that the animal showed rapid linear growth early in ontogeny, sexual maturity in perhaps the 9th year of life, and that it died in the 19th year of life. Our data adds to a growing body of evidence that a genetically distinct northern dinosaurian fauna existed at high paleolatitudes in Alaska during the Late Cretaceous.},

  abstract = {In 1910 a crew from the American Museum of Natural History discovered a bone bed composed primarily of the large tyrannosaurid Albertosaurus sarcophagus in what is now Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada. Study of the remains from the site allowed the first life table and survivorship curve for a non-avian dinosaur to be created. These have served as a model for subsequent studies of dinosaurian population biology. Since 2006, the discovery and preparation of hundreds of new elements from the bone bed stand to substantially increase the minimum number of individuals (MNI) represented. This would allow testing of previous conclusions regarding the population biology of these animals and refinement of our understanding of the patterns of survivorship. Here, four formerly unrecognized individuals from the Dry Island assemblage are revealed and a revised life table presented. As in the previous analysis, a left skewed age distribution and sigmoidal survivorship pattern were found. Annual mortality rates averaged 3.47\% between ages two and 13 and then increased to a mean of 19.5\% prior to extinction of the cohort after 28~years of age. Mean life expectancy for individuals surviving to two years of age was 15.19~years. Mid-life increase in attrition corresponds to entrance into the breeding population. The MNI is unlikely to substantially increase, and new individuals are unlikely to affect the pattern of survivorship inferred here. Nevertheless, future excavations stand to reveal more about the anatomical and pathological variance within the Dry Island Albertosaurus population.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The distribution of organic forms is clumpy at any scale from populations to the highest taxonomic categories, and whether considered within clades or within ecosystems. The fossil record provides little support for expectations that the morphological gaps between species or groups of species have increased through time as it might if the gaps were created by extinction of a more homogeneous distribution of morphologies. As the quantitative assessments of morphology have replaced counts of higher taxa as a metric of morphological disparity, numerous studies have demonstrated the rapid construction of morphospace early in evolutionary radiations, and have emphasized the difference between taxonomic measures of morphological diversity and quantitative assessments of disparity. Other studies have evaluated changing patterns of disparity across mass extinctions, ecomorphological patterns and the patterns of convergence within ecological communities, while the development of theoretical morphology has greatly aided efforts to understand why some forms do not occur. A parallel, and until recently, largely separate research effort in evolutionary developmental biology has established that the developmental toolkit underlying the remarkable breadth of metazoan form is largely identical among Bilateria, and many components are shared among all metazoa. Underlying this concern with disparity is a question about temporal variation in the production of morphological innovations, a debate over the relative significance of the generation of new morphologies vs. differential probabilities of their successful introduction, and the relative importance of constraint, convergence and contingency in the evolution of form.},

Here we use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to study the static allometry of two species of sexually dimorphic electric fishes (Apteronotus rostratus and Compsaraia samueli) in which mature males grow elongate jaws used in agonistic male–male interactions. We also estimate jaw-closing performance between the sexes of both species to track changes in kinematic transmission associated with the development of sexual weaponry. We find significantly different patterns of static allometry between the sexes of both species, with males exhibiting more positive allometric slopes relative to females. We also find a negative relationship between skull shape and mandibular kinematic transmission in C. samueli, suggesting a trade-off where males with longer faces exhibit lower mechanical advantages, suggesting weaker jaw leverage. In contrast, males and females of A. rostratus exhibit no difference between sexes in mechanical advantage associated with facial elongation.},

Each bonebed is hosted by a decimetre-thick deposit of poorly sorted and graded organic-fragment-rich mudstone. These fossil deposits are interpreted as having been carried and deposited by debris flows or hyperconcentrated mass sediment flows initiated by overbank flooding from local channels. Each bonebed is dominated ({$>$}50\% of identifiable elements) by the disarticulated to occasionally associated remains of hadrosaurine hadrosaurids, inferred to be Edmontosaurus regalis. The majority of hadrosaurid elements at two of the sites (Bleriot Ferry and Prehistoric Park) are from large, presumably adult-sized individuals, whereas the majority of elements from the Fox Coulee site are from subadults and juveniles. Fossil elements from all the sites exhibit similar taphonomic signatures suggestive of a high degree of biostratinomic modification including: (i) thorough disarticulation of carcasses, (ii) a large amount of breakage, (iii) modest amounts of size sorting, and (iv) minimum to modest occurrences of abrasion, and scratch and tooth marks. These signatures indicate that carcasses were exposed for significant amounts of time on the floodplain, where they rotted, were scavenged and trampled, and were exposed to moving water prior to final burial. The size of each bonebed together with the density of bones suggest that the biocoenoses comprised large groups of hadrosaurids, and bone size distributions suggest the possibility of age-segregated populations. The monodominant nature of the assemblages combined with homogenous taphonomic signatures within and between sites suggests that these bonebed assemblages are best interpreted as the result of mass kills rather than attrition, with recurring tropical storm-induced coastal-plain flooding postulated as a likely mechanism for what killed and eventually buried these dinosaurs.},

However, universal models of such fundamental growth and form are rare, presumably due to the limited number of physical laws and biological processes that influence growth. One such model is the logarithmic spiral, which has been purported to explain the growth of biological structures such as teeth, claws, horns, and beaks. However, the logarithmic spiral only describes the path of the structure through space, and cannot generate these shapes.},

  abstract = {Triassic tetrapods are of key importance in understanding their evolutionary history, because several tetrapod clades, including most of their modern lineages, first appeared or experienced their initial evolutionary radiation during this Period. In order to test previous palaeobiogeographical hypotheses of Triassic tetrapod faunas, tree reconciliation analyses (TRA) were performed with the aim of recovering biogeographical patterns based on phylogenetic signals provided by a composite tree of Middle and Late Triassic tetrapods. The TRA found significant evidence for the presence of different palaeobiogeographical patterns during the analysed time spans. First, a Pangaean distribution is observed during the Middle Triassic, in which several cosmopolitan tetrapod groups are found. During the early Late Triassic a strongly palaeolatitudinally influenced pattern is recovered, with some tetrapod lineages restricted to palaeolatitudinal belts. During the latest Triassic, Gondwanan territories were more closely related to each other than to Laurasian ones, with a distinct tetrapod fauna at low palaeolatitudes. Finally, more than 75 per cent of the cladogenetic events recorded in the tetrapod phylogeny occurred as sympatric splits or within-area vicariance, indicating that evolutionary processes at the regional level were the main drivers in the radiation of Middle and Late Triassic tetrapods and the early evolution of several modern tetrapod lineages.},

  abstract = {Ecological studies of extant tetrapod predators indicate that morphologically similar species which coexist in the same habitats routinely reduce interspecific competition for food by regular spacing of body size. The biggest predator species in the assemblage often differ more from one another in size than the smallest species. When coexisting carnivore species do not differ greatly in size, they commonly show morphological differences related to prey handling that may reduce dietary overlap. If carnivore species are very similar in both size and morphology, competition is avoided by habitat partitioning. Two tyrannosaurid species from the late Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation of western Canada are similar in both size and morphology, suggesting that they were segregated on the basis of habitat and/or biogeographic province. However; consideration of the living-space requirements of predator species of such large body size suggests that this kind of spatial separation would only have been possible had tyrannosaurids been more like ectotherms than endotherms in their metabolic rates. Distribution of different large theropod species across different, and surprisingly small (for the size of the animals) portions of Mesozoic landscapes may also account for the remarkably high diversity of morphologically similar large theropods in other dinosaur faunas.},

Models of megaherbivore population density (number of individuals per square kilometer) that attempt to take into account ecosystem productivity, the size structure of megaherbivore populations, and individual megaherbivore energy requirements, when combined with values of the large theropod/megaherbivore abundance ratio, suggest that large theropods may have been more abundant on the landscape than estimates extrapolated from the population density versus body mass relationship of mammalian carnivores. Models of the meat production of megaherbivore populations and the meat requirements of “adult” large theropods suggest that herbivore productivity would have been insufficient to support the associated number of individuals of “adult” large theropods, unless the herbivore production/biomass ratio was substantially higher, and/or the large theropod meat requirement markedly lower, than expectations based on modern mammals.

We constrain Morrison megaherbivore abundance by modelling dinosaur abundance in terms of carrying capacity (K), average body mass (ABM) and animal's energy needs. Two kinds of model are presented: ‘demand-side’ models that estimate K in terms of the aggregate energy demand of the dinosaur community, and ‘supply-side’ models that estimate K in terms of retrodicted primary productivity. Baseline values of K, ABM and energy needs for the models are further derived from comparisons with modern large herbivores, and from the composition of the megaherbivore fauna from a particular stratigraphic interval of the Morrison, but in all models a broad range of fractions and multiples of these baseline parameters are considered. ‘Best-guess’ estimates of Morrison megaherbivore abundance suggest an upper limit of a few hundred animals across all taxa and size classes per square kilometre, and up to a few tens of individuals of large subadults and adults.},

For over 50 Ma in the Jurassic until the Early Cretaceous, plesiosaurians, ichthyosaurians and thalattosuchian crocodylomorphs coexisted at the top levels of trophic food webs. We created a functional dataset of continuous craniomandibular and dental characters known from neontological studies to be functionally significant in modern aquatic tetrapods. We analysed this dataset with multivariate ordination and inferential statistics to assess functional similarities and differences in the marine reptile faunas of two well-sampled Jurassic ecosystems deposited in the same seaway: the Oxford Clay Formation (OCF, Callovian–early Oxfordian, Middle–Late Jurassic) and the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF, Kimmeridgian–Tithonian, Late Jurassic) of the UK. Lower jaw-based macroevolutionary trends are similar to those of tooth-based diversity studies. Closely related species cluster together, with minimal overlaps in the morphospace. Marine reptile lineages were characterized by the distinctive combinations of features, but we reveal multiple instances of morphofunctional convergence among different groups. We quantitatively corroborate previous observations that the ecosystems in the OCF and KCF were markedly distinct in faunal composition and structure. Morphofunctional differentiation may have enabled specialization and was an important factor facilitating the coexistence of diverse marine reptile assemblages in deep time.},

Despite the benefits associated with these newer imaging techniques, there remains a need for more “traditional” methods of morphological examination in many comparative studies. In this paper, we describe the costs and benefits of the various methods of visualizing, examining, and comparing morphological structures. There are significant differences in the costs associated with these different methods (monetary, time, equipment, and software), but also in the degree to which specimens are destroyed. We argue not for any one particular method over another in morphological studies, but instead suggest a combination of methods is useful not only for breadth of visualization, but also for the financial and time constraints often imposed on early-career research scientists.},

When correlations exist between independent variables, as is generally the case with ecological datasets, this procedure leads to biased parameter estimates. Standard multiple regression, by contrast, yields unbiased parameter estimates. 3 In multiple regression parameters are estimated controlling for the effects of the other variables in the model, and thus multiple regression achieves what residual regression claims to do. 4 Several measures of correlation exist that differ in the way that variance is partitioned among independent variables. These can be estimated multiply, or sequentially if reasons exist for estimating effects of variables in a hierarchical manner.},

  abstract = {Questions related to dinosaur behavior can be difficult to answer conclusively by using morphological studies alone. As a complement to these approaches, carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of tooth enamel can provide insight into habitat and dietary preferences of herbivorous dinosaurs. This approach is based on the isotopic variability in plant material and in surface waters of the past, which is in turn reflected by carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of animals that ingested the organic matter or drank the water. Thus, it has the potential to identify and characterize dietary and habitat preferences for coexisting taxa.In this study, stable isotope ratios from coexisting hadrosaurian and ceratopsian dinosaurs of the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota are compared for four different stratigraphic levels. Isotopic offsets between tooth enamel and tooth dentine, as well as taxonomic differences in means and in patterns of isotopic data among taxa, indicate that primary paleoecological information is preserved. The existence of taxonomic offsets also provides the first direct evidence for dietary niche partitioning among these herbivorous dinosaur taxa. Of particular interest is the observation that the nature of this partitioning changes over time: for some localities ceratopsian dinosaurs have higher carbon and oxygen isotope ratios than hadrosaurs, indicating a preference for plants living in open settings near the coast, whereas for other localities isotope ratios are lower, indicating a preference for plants in the understory of forests. In most cases the isotope ratios among hadrosaurs are similar and are interpreted to represent a dietary preference for plants of the forest canopy. The inferred differences in ceratopsian behavior are suggested to represent a change in vegetation cover and hence habitat availability in response to sea level change or to the position of river distributaries. Given our current lack of taxonomic resolution, it is not possible to determine if dietary and habitat preferences inferred from stable isotope data are associated with single, or multiple, species of hadrosaurian/ceratopsian dinosaurs.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of caenagnathids has benefited from recent discoveries, including nearly complete skeletons from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. However, their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. A new specimen from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta has implications for the phylogeny and paleobiology of these creatures. The partial skeleton is articulated and includes a mandible, a full cervical and dorsal series of vertebrae, a right pectoral girdle and arm, a sternum, gastralia, a partial ilium, and a partial hind limb. The mandible is edentulous and the articular ridge is intermediate in form between Caenagnathus collinsi and Chirostenotes pergracilis. The neck is long and composed of at least 11 well-pneumatized cervical vertebrae with fused cervical ribs. The dorsal ribs have finger-like uncinate processes dissimilar in shape to those of other oviraptorosaurs. The pectoral girdle is large and typically maniraptoran, except that the glenoid of the scapulocoracoid faces laterally instead of posteroventrally. The arm is well muscled and can be interpreted to have been a pennibrachium, as indicated by ulnar papillae on the ulna. The manus is characterized by a short first metacarpal but an elongate phalanx I-1 and oviraptorid-like phalangeal proportions in the second digit. These and other features indicate that the specimen represents a new taxon, Apatoraptor pennatus, gen. et sp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis resolves the complicated relationships of Caenagnathidae and allows the evolution of display features to be traced throughout Oviraptorosauria. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:122957D7-F65F-4A2C-86AF-386AE8AAF2C4 SUPPLEMENTAL DATA—Supplemental materials are available for this article for free at www.tandfonline.com/UJVP Citation for this article: Funston, G.

  abstract = {It has long been debated why groups such as non-avian dinosaurs became extinct whereas mammals and other lineages survived the Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction 66 million years ago. We used Markov networks, ecological niche partitioning, and Earth System models to reconstruct North American food webs and simulate ecospace occupancy before and after the extinction event. We find a shift in latest Cretaceous dinosaur faunas, as medium-sized species counterbalanced a loss of megaherbivores, but dinosaur niches were otherwise stable and static, potentially contributing to their demise. Smaller vertebrates, including mammals, followed a consistent trajectory of increasing trophic impact and relaxation of niche limits beginning in the latest Cretaceous and continuing after the mass extinction. Mammals did not simply proliferate after the extinction event; rather, their earlier ecological diversification might have helped them survive.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Some of the bite marks are in the form of exceptionally deep punctures through the long bone cortices. These provide a rare opportunity to estimate the bite-force capacities of this taxon through tooth indentation simulations. These experiments showed that approximately 4100 N of bite force were required to generate one of the bite marks, and 8200 N would have been generated simultaneously at a distal-most tooth position. These values are higher than those reported for large carnivoran mammals but similar to values recorded for comparably sized crocodilians. Although current evidence does not indicate how D. antirrhopus actually used its claws and teeth to acquire prey resources, it is clear that large individuals were capable of generating forces great enough to bite through bone.},

  abstract = {The upper Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation (DPF) is a south- and eastward-thinning fluvial to marginal-marine clastic wedge in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. The DPF is overlain by the Bearpaw Formation (BF), a fully marine clastic succession representing the final major transgression of this epicontinental sea across western North America. In southwestern Saskatchewan, the DPF is comprised of marginal-marine coal, carbonaceous shale, and heterolithic siltstone and sandstone grading vertically into marine sandstone and shale of the BF. Historically these deposits have been interpreted as the record of fluvial delta systems along a paleocoastline. This study revisits this interpretation using integration of ichnologic, sedimentologic, and sequence stratigraphic concepts. Detailed facies analysis indicates the upper DPF does not record sedimentation in a delta system, but rather was deposited in a low-relief coastal plain with a wave-dominated, tidally influenced, fluvially modified shoreline. Marginal-marine facies, interpreted as lagoons, tidal flats and estuaries, are bioturbated, showing a typical brackish-water trace-fossil assemblage, including Asterosoma isp., Chondrites isp., Cylindrichnus concentricus, Teichichnus rectus, and Skolithos isp. Fine-grained sandstone was deposited in an estuarine mouth-bar and barrier-island complex that protected the coast from wave reworking. As the seaway transgressed across the coast, fully marine wave-dominated parasequences replaced those of the coastal plain. Typical trace fossils include Asterosoma isp., Chondrites isp., Diplocraterion isp., Nereites missouriensis, Phycosiphon incertum, Planolites isp., Rhizocorallium isp., and Zoophycos isp., reflecting open, fully marine conditions. This study provides new insights into the evolution of depositional environments in the Late Cretaceous of southwestern Saskatchewan, and provides a framework for further geological and paleontological studies ongoing in the region.},

  abstract = {The Belly River Group (BRG) in southwestern Saskatchewan records the interplay of accommodation space and base level in an epicontinental seaway. The Belly River Group has been the focus of numerous studies concerned with sedimentology, stratigraphy, and paleontology in Alberta and Montana, due to extensive badlands exposure, exceptional three-dimensional preservation of many sedimentary features, and the vast paleontologic data available from the deposits. The BRG has been studied with far less detail in Saskatchewan, due to the poor and sporadic nature of available outcrop, and comparatively little subsurface data. This study synthesizes all available data for the BRG in southwestern Saskatchewan, effectively characterizing the sedimentology, stratigraphy, ichnology, and paleontology and provides a comprehensive framework for these deposits in the province. This study provides critical insights into the BRG, particularly in regards to sequence stratigraphy. During the Campanian, the Western Interior Seaway bisected North America, and its western shore was located in southern Saskatchewan. This study provides critical insights into shoreline dynamics, both from a geologic and paleontologic perspective, and how these dynamics influence deposits further inland not directly in contact with the seaway. This study highlights the utility of integrating multiple, distinct datasets to understand depositional evolution along coastal plains, and its effects on biodiversity. McLean (1971) characterized the uppermost deposits of the BRG (then called the Judith River Group) in the Cypress Hills as being deposited in an extensive delta plain. In Chapter 3, detailed facies analysis indicates the upper DPF does not record sedimentation in a delta system. A reinterpretation determines the DPF was deposited in a low-relief coastal plain with a wave-dominated, tidally influenced, fluvially modified shoreline. Marginal-marine facies, interpreted as lagoons, tidal flats and estuaries, display a typical brackish-water trace-fossil assemblage, including Asterosoma isp., Chondrites isp., Cylindrichnus concentricus, Teichichnus rectus, and Skolithos isp. Fine-grained sandstone deposited in an estuarine mouth-bar and barrier-island complex protected the coast from wave reworking. As the seaway transgressed across the coast, fully marine wave-dominated parasequences replaced those of the coastal plain. Typical trace fossils include Asterosoma isp., Chondrites isp., Diplocraterion isp., Nereites missouriensis, Phycosiphon incertum, Planolites isp., Rhizocorallium isp., and Zoophycos isp., reflecting open, fully marine conditions. In Chapter 4, the Belly River Group and its associated formations are formally recognized for the first time in Saskatchewan with facies, depositional environments, and sequence stratigraphic framework interpreted to provide a concise treatment of the deposits in southwestern Saskatchewan. A new lithostratigraphic unit within the uppermost Dinosaur Park Formation is recognized based on laterally extensive barrier island, lagoon, and estuary basin deposits. The Manâtakâw Member is established as a means to aide in discussing the transition from nonmarine clastics of the BRG to marine shales of the overlying Bearpaw Formation. Unincised and incised valley systems are explored in detail, with lowstand systems tract deposits compared and contrasted between the Oldman and Dinosaur Park formations. Chapters 5 and 6 discuss microvertebrate localities from the Dinosaur Park Formation, one at Lake Diefenbaker (Ch. 5), and the other at Woodpile Coulee (Ch. 6). Palynology, ichnology, sedimentology, and vertebrate paleontology are integrated to determine paleoenvironmental and paleoecological conditions in the two regions and their stratigraphic positions. Both sites are interpreted as having been deposited at different times during transgression of the encroaching Bearpaw Sea. Though well studied and sampled in Alberta, the Dinosaur Park Formation is poorly exposed with little known associated vertebrate assemblages in Saskatchewan. These discoveries from the microvertebrate sites offer new insights into Late Cretaceous ecosystems near paleocoastlines, allowing for future studies of spatial diversity patterns relative to Albertan faunas.},

  abstract = {The Eocene to Miocene Cypress Hills Formation (CHF) spans 28 million years and forms the conglomeratic caprock of the Cypress Hills and Swift Current plateaus in southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta. These stacked fluvial, floodplain, and lacustrine deposits preserve the only high latitude, non-polar mammalian fossil assemblage (Uintan to Hemingfordian land mammal stages) in Canada. The Quarry is the oldest CHF (Chadronian 1, late Eocene) site documented in the Cypress Hills region north of the town of Eastend. The Quarry was originally discovered in 1962, after bones were found to be eroding out of the base of a road cut north of the ghost town of South Fork on the southeastern flanks of the Cypress Hills. Numerous field campaigns have resulted in the collection of fossils from a multitaxonomic bonebed. This paper presents a detailed sedimentologic, paleontologic, and taphonomic study to establish a depositional environment framework of the Southfork Quarry. This site was deposited at the onset of the Eocene–Oligocene climate transition, a critical time of climate change during the Paleogene. Six facies and two facies associations are characterized for the Quarry, shifting from a braided-fluvial system to a debris flow-filled incised channel. Patterns of skeletal accumulations and bone surface modification indicate that the assemblage accumulated over a significant interval of time in different depositional environments. This study provides critical insight into environmental shifts driven by climate change and relates these findings to a broader understanding of the Eocene–Oligocene transition in North America.},

These plots were used to examine possible function and ecological characteristics of fossil reef fish assemblages throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. A previously unknown trend of increasing orbit diameter over time became apparent. The Teleostei are the principal drivers of this change. The Eocene appears to mark a dramatic increase in two previously rare feeding modes in fishes: nocturnal feeding and high-precision benthic feeding. Interestingly, members of the Pycnodontiformes had relatively large eyes since the Triassic and appear to be the ecological precursors of their later teleost counterparts and may have been among the earliest nocturnal feeding fishes. Our results highlight potential changes in the roles of fishes on coral reefs through time.},

Whereas high degrees of sexual size dimorphism characterize many of the large-bodied anthropoids, this is not the case for extinct large-bodied lemurs. This paper uses finite mixture analysis and other techniques to ascertain just how much skull length dimorphism might be embedded in the generally unimodal distributions of skull lengths of giant extinct lemurs from single localities, and then compares these results with known skull length dimorphisms in extant lemurs and large-bodied catarrhines. We show that low levels of skull length sexual dimorphism (or none at all) characterize subfossil lemurs, and we explore several possible explanations for this phenomenon. Traditional explanations of sexual size dimorphism generally focus on body size or mating systems. These are not sufficient to explain the variation in sexual dimorphism that can be observed in the order Primates. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Many industries are required to monitor themselves in meeting regulatory policies intended to protect the environment. Self-reporting of environmental performance can place the cost of monitoring on companies rather than taxpayers, but there are obvious risks of bias, often addressed through external audits or inspections. Surprisingly, there have been relatively few empirical analyses of bias in industry self-reported data. Here, we test for bias in reporting of environmental compliance data using a unique data set from Canadian salmon farms, where companies monitor the number of parasitic sea lice on fish in open sea pens, in order to minimize impacts on wild fish in surrounding waters. We fit a hierarchical population-dynamics model to these sea-louse count data using a Bayesian approach. We found that the industry's monthly counts of two sea-louse species, Caligus clemensi and Lepeophtheirus salmonis, increased by a factor of 1.95 (95\% credible interval: 1.57, 2.42) and 1.18 (1.06, 1.31), respectively, in months when counts were audited by the federal fisheries department. Consequently, industry sea-louse counts are less likely to trigger costly but mandated delousing treatments intended to avoid sea-louse epidemics in wild juvenile salmon. These results highlight the potential for combining external audits of industry self-reported data with analyses of their reporting to maintain compliance with regulations, achieve intended conservation goals, and build public confidence in the process.},

It is a product of one event: the Permian extinction (which affected brachiopods profoundly and clams relatively little). When Paleozoic and post-Paleozoic times are plotted separately, numbers of clam and brachiopod genera are positively correlated in each phase. Each group pursues its characteristic and different history in each phase—clams increasing, brachiopods holding their own. The Permian extinction simply reset the initial diversities. The two groups seem to track each other in each phase and a plot of brachiopod vs. clam residuals (each from their own within-phase regressions against time) yields significantly positive association. Some of this tracking may be an artifact of available rock volumes; we could, however, detect no effect of stage lengths. Passive extrapolation of microevolutionary theory into the vastness of geological time has often led paleontologists astray. Competitive interaction may rule in local populations, but differential response to mass extinctions (surely not a matter of conventional competition) may set the relative histories of large groups through geological time. Similarly, adaptive superiority in design cannot, in the usual sense of optimal engineering, have much to do with the macroevolutionary success of clams. The interesting question lies one step further back: what in the inherited Bauplan of a clam permits flexibility in design and why are other groups, however successful in their own domain, unable to alter their basic design.},

  abstract = {Certain times of major biotic replacement have often been interpreted as broadly competitive, mediated by innovation in the succeeding clades. A classic example was the switch from brachiopods to bivalves as major seabed organisms following the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (PTME), \textasciitilde 252 million years ago. This was attributed to competitive exclusion of brachiopods by the better adapted bivalves or simply to the fact that brachiopods had been hit especially hard by the PTME. The brachiopod-bivalve switch is emblematic of the global turnover of marine faunas from Palaeozoic-type to Modern-type triggered by the PTME. Here, using Bayesian analyses, we find that unexpectedly the two clades displayed similar large-scale trends of diversification before the Jurassic. Insight from a multivariate birth-death model shows that the extinction of major brachiopod clades during the PTME set the stage for the brachiopod-bivalve switch, with differential responses to high ocean temperatures post-extinction further facilitating their displacement by bivalves. Our study strengthens evidence that brachiopods and bivalves were not competitors over macroevolutionary time scales, with extinction events and environmental stresses shaping their divergent fates.},

  abstract = {The aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction provided ecological opportunities for many groups of reptiles, marking the beginning of reptile dominance of the Mesozoic oceans. Clades such as ichthyosaurs, thalattosuchians, sauropterygians, mosasaurs and turtles evolved a remarkable diversity of ecological niches and became important components of aquatic ecosystems. Locomotion is a key aspect of ecology, crucial for many biological functions such as foraging and migration. However, the evolution of locomotory adaptations across all Mesozoic marine reptiles remains poorly understood. Here we present multivariate and disparity analyses based on body proportions, body size and post-cranial proxies for locomotion in 125 species of Mesozoic marine reptiles. Our analysis highlights key anatomical transformations in the evolution of swimming modes, characterizing two divergent evolutionary paths in the transition from drag-based to lift-based propulsion in both the axial and appendicular spectrum. Analyses against geological time do not show evidence for an explosive radiation after the end-Permian extinction, pointing instead to a gradual increase in locomotory disparity during the whole Mesozoic, which reached the highest levels in the Cretaceous. Our analysis also provides insight into the evolution of locomotion in particular clades. Some notable findings are the high aquatic specialization in the earliest ichthyosauromorphs and the morphospace overlap between mosasauroids and ichthyosauromorphs.},

  abstract = {Large ornithopod dinosaur footprints have been confirmed on all continents except Antarctica since the 19th century. However, oversplitting problems in ichnotaxa have historically been observed in these footprints. To address these issues and distinguish between validated ichnotaxa, this study employed convolutional neural network-based Xception transfer learning to automatically classify ornithopod dinosaur tracks. The machine learning model was trained for 162 epochs (i.e., the number of full cycles of all training data through the model) using 274 data images, excluding horizontally flipped images. The trained model accuracy was 96.36\%, and the validation accuracy was 92.59\%. We demonstrate the performance of the machine learning model using footprint illustrations that are not included in the training dataset. These results show that the machine learning model developed in this study can properly classify footprint illustration data for large ornithopod dinosaurs. However, the quality of footprint illustration data (or images) inherently affects the performance of our machine learning model, which performs better on well-preserved footprints. In addition, because the developed machine-learning model is a typical supervised learning model, it is not possible to introduce a new label or class. Although this study used illustrations rather than photos or 3D data, it is the first application of machine-learning techniques at the academic level for verifying the ichnotaxonic assignments of large ornithopod dinosaur footprints. Furthermore, the machine learning model will likely aid researchers to classify the large ornithopod dinosaur footprint ichnotaxa, thereby safeguarding against the oversplitting problem.},

Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

This report provides a brief synthesis of the literature and current concepts for the Horseshoe Canyon Formation Strata. The objective was to present a regional stratigraphic analysis integrating outcrop measurements and subsurface log correlations. In particular, a series of outcrop measured sections and nearby subsurface well cross-sections were studied to better understand the regional stratigraphy, sedimentology and resource potential of the sandy upper Campanian-Maastrichtian strata of southern Alberta. The upper boundary of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was formally revised to better reflect recent data and understanding. A more recognizable stratigraphic subdivision for the strata was delineated . The paper also describes and interprets the general facies that recur throughout the formations, and establishes a regional stratigraphic framework based on the inter-tonguing of marine and non marine units. The ultimate objective of the study was to reduce risk in exploration and exploitation of these resources. refs., tabs., figs.},

The body mass of temnospondyls is a key variable in inferring their ecological, physiological and biomechanical attributes. However, estimating the body mass of these extinct creatures has proven difficult because the group has no extant descendants. Here we apply a wide range of body mass estimation techniques developed for tetrapods to the iconic temnospondyls Paracyclotosaurus davidi and Eryops megacephalus. These same methods are also applied to a collection of extant organisms that serve as ecological and morphological analogues. These include the giant salamanders Andrias japonicus and Andrias davidianus, the tiger salamander Ambystoma tigrinum, the California newt Taricha torosa and the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus. We find that several methods can provide accurate mass estimations across this range of living taxa, suggesting their suitability for estimating the body masses of temnospondyls. Based on this, we estimate the mass of Paracyclotosaurus to have been between 159 and 365 kg, and that of Eryops between 102 and 222 kg. These findings provide a basis for examining body size evolution in this clade across their entire temporal span.},

  abstract = {Using morphometrics to study nonavian dinosaur fossils is a practice that predates the origin of the word “dinosaur.” By the 1970s, linear morphometrics had become established as a valuable tool for analyzing intra- and interspecific variation in nonavian dinosaurs. With the advent of more recent techniques such as geometric morphometrics and more advanced statistical approaches, morphometric analyses of nonavian dinosaurs have proliferated, granting unprecedented insight into many aspects of their biology and evolution. I outline the past, present, and future of morphometrics as applied to the study of nonavian dinosaurs zeroing in on five aspects of nonavian dinosaur paleobiology where morphometrics has been widely utilized to advance our knowledge: systematics, sexual dimorphism, locomotion, macroevolution, and trackways. Morphometric methods are especially susceptible to taphonomic distortion. As such, the impact of taphonomic distortion on original fossil shape is discussed as are current and future methods for quantifying and accounting for distortion with the goal of reducing the taphonomic noise to biological signal ratio. Finally, the future of morphometrics in nonavian dinosaur paleobiology is discussed as paleobiologists move into a “virtual paleobiology” framework, whereby digital renditions of fossils are captured via methods such as photogrammetry and computed tomography. These primary data form the basis for three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric analyses along with a slew of other forms of analyses. These 3D specimen data form part of the extended specimen and help to democratize paleobiology, unlocking the specimen from the physical museum and making the specimen available to researchers across the world.},

All but one of the seven trackways attributed to hatchling tyrannosaurids occur as codirectional, equally spaced pairs, but one pair walked in the opposite direction, albeit parallel, to the other two. The pair of ornithomimid trackways also appears to represent two animals walking at the same speed, in the same direction, and turning together. The trackway attributed to a medium-sized biped, possibly Parksosaurus warreni, is the first evidence for the presence of these dinosaurs in the environment recorded by the St. Mary River Formation.},

Ammonites and inoceramids exhibit distinct stable-isotope values: inoceramids have higher δ13C values (0.6‰ to 5.0‰) and lower δ18O values (−4.0‰ to −2.8‰), whereas coeval baculitid ammonites have lower δ13C values (−4.8‰ to −0.3‰) and higher δ18O values (−2.3‰ to 0.0‰), with other ammonites having stable-isotope values ranging between the baculitids and inoceramids. The isotopic composition of the inoceramids and ammonites are unlikely due to kinetic or vital effects because species from open ocean environments have values expected from marine water and there is no correlation between the δ13C and δ18O values of the inceramids as has been reported for modern foraminifers and calcareous algae suspected of exerting vital effects. The heterogeneity in stable-isotope values of coeval molluscs implies that the Bearpaw Sea was isotopically stratified. Isotopic exchange between the water and sediments, and the formation of 18O-depleted deepwater mass by mixing of Tethyan and Boreal waters in the WIS, may have caused such isotopic stratification.},

In all cases, body lengths of all individuals were inferred from dental parameters and the size-class structure was estimated from kernel probability density functions and Gaussian mixture models. Our analyses support the presence of five potential nurseries ranging from the Langhian (middle Miocene) to the Zanclean (Pliocene), with higher densities of individuals with estimated body lengths within the typical range of neonates and young juveniles. These results reveal, for the first time, that nursery areas were commonly used by O. megalodon over large temporal and spatial scales, reducing early mortality and playing a key role in maintaining viable adult populations. Ultimately, the presumed reliance of O. megalodon on the presence of suitable nursery grounds might have also been determinant in the demise of this iconic top predatory shark.},

  abstract = {Patterns of last occurrences of fossil species are often used to infer the tempo and timing of mass extinction, even though last occurrences generally precede the time of extinction. Numerical simulations with constant extinction demonstrate that last occurrences are not randomly distributed, but tend to cluster at subaerial unconformities, surfaces of forced regression, flooding surfaces and intervals of stratigraphical condensation, all of which occur in predictable stratigraphical positions. This clustering arises not only from hiatuses and non-deposition, but also from changes in water depth. Simulations with intervals of elevated extinction cause such clusters of last occurrences to be enhanced within and below the interval of extinction, suggesting that the timing and magnitude of extinctions in these instances could be misinterpreted. With the possible exception of the end-Cretaceous, mass extinctions in the fossil record are characterized by clusters of last occurrences at these sequence stratigraphical horizons. Although these clusters of last occurrences may represent brief pulses of elevated extinction, they are equally likely to form by stratigraphical processes during a protracted period (more than several hundred thousand years) of elevated extinction rate. Geochemical proxies of extinction causes are also affected similarly, suggesting that many local expressions of mass extinction should be re-evaluated for the timing of extinction and its relation to environmental change. We propose three tests for distinguishing pulses of extinction from clusters of last occurrences produced by stratigraphical processes.},

  abstract = {The skull of Plioplatecarpus possesses large orbits and a large parietal foramen. Although the large orbits suggest that Plioplatecarpus possessed large eyes with enhanced visual performance, none of the previously described skulls include a sclerotic ring, and so it has been impossible in the past to reconstruct their size or optical properties. A recently collected skull with a sclerotic ring preserved in situ provides for the first time the data to do so. The dimensions of the sclerotic ring demonstrate that, although the f-number of the eyeball was not low enough to support the hypothesis that Plioplatecarpus was adapted to low light conditions, the eyeball was nevertheless large and possessed increased visual acuity and sensitivity that enabled the mosasaur to operate efficiently in both light-rich and light-poor conditions and possibly other conditions of reduced visibility. Proportions of this skull also suggest that Plioplatecarpus possessed a relatively wide binocular field of vision, providing stereoscopic vision, and further increasing both acuity and sensitivity, enhancing its ability to effectively detect and track quickly moving objects under a wide range of light conditions. A greatly enlarged parietal foramen implies the presence of a large parietal eye, the significance of which is uncertain, but it may have enhanced the ability to regulate migratory behavior.},

  abstract = {Mosasaurs (Squamata, Mosasauridae) were large aquatic reptiles from the Late Cretaceous that filled a range of ecological niches within marine ecosystems. The type-Maastrichtian strata (68–66~Ma) of the Netherlands and Belgium preserve remains of five species that seemed to have performed different ecological roles (carnivores, piscivores, durophages). However, many interpretations of mosasaur diet and niche partitioning are based on qualitative types of evidence that are difficult to test explicitly. Here, we apply three-dimensional dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) to provide quantitative dietary constraints for type-Maastrichtian mosasaurs, and to assess levels of niche partitioning between taxa. DMTA indicates that these mosasaurs did not exhibit neatly defined diets or strict dietary partitioning. Instead, we identify three broad groups: (i) mosasaurs Carinodens belgicus and Plioplatecarpus marshi plotting in the space of modern reptiles that are predominantly piscivorous and/or consume harder invertebrate prey, (ii) Prognathodon saturator and Prognathodon sectorius overlapping with extant reptiles that consume larger amounts of softer invertebrate prey items, and (iii) Mosasaurus hoffmanni spanning a larger plot area in terms of dietary constraints. The clear divide between the aforementioned first two groups in texture-dietary space indicates that, despite our small sample sizes, this method shows the potential of DMTA to test hypotheses and provide quantitative constraints on mosasaur diets and ecological roles.},

Using body-size data from both Alligator mississippiensis and Rhea americana, which phylogenetically bracket the dinosaurs, we demonstrate that even when there is strong dimorphism in a species, random sampling of populations of individuals characterized by sustained periods of growth (as in the alligator and most dinosaurs) can result in the loss of this signal. Dimorphism may be common in fossil taxa but very hard to detect without ontogenetic age control and large sample sizes, both of which are hampered by the limitations of the fossil record. Signal detection may be further hindered by Type III survivorship, whereby increased mortality among the young favours the likelihood that they will be sampled (unless predation or taphonomic bias against small size acts against this). These, and other considerations relating to behaviour and ecology, provide powerful reasons to suggest that sexual dimorphism in dinosaurs may be very difficult to detect in almost all currently available samples. Similar issues are likely also to be applicable to many fossil reptiles, or animals more generally.},

  abstract = {Cranial ornamentation is widespread throughout the extinct non-avialian Ornithodira, being present throughout Pterosauria, Ornithischia and Saurischia. Ornaments take many forms, and can be composed of at least a dozen different skull bones, indicating multiple origins. Many of these crests serve no clear survival function and it has been suggested that their primary use was for species recognition or sexual display. The distribution within Ornithodira and the form and position of these crests suggest sexual selection as a key factor, although the role of the latter has often been rejected on the grounds of an apparent lack of sexual dimorphism in many species. Surprisingly, the phenomenon of mutual sexual selection – where both males and females are ornamented and both select mates – has been ignored in research on fossil ornithodirans, despite a rich history of research and frequent expression in modern birds. Here, we review the available evidence for the functions of ornithodiran cranial crests and conclude that mutual sexual selection presents a valid hypothesis for their presence and distribution. The integration of mutual sexual selection into future studies is critical to our understanding of ornithodiran ecology, evolution and particularly questions regarding sexual dimorphism.

Recent papers have added considerable knowledge of the anatomy of the genus with the discovery of a new and much more complete specimen, but this has also brought new and dramatic interpretations of its ecology as a highly specialised semi-aquatic animal that actively pursued aquatic prey. Here we assess the arguments about the functional morphology of this animal and the available data on its ecology and possible habits in the light of these new finds. We conclude that based on the available data, the degree of adaptations for aquatic life are questionable, other interpretations for the tail fin and other features are supported (e.g., socio-sexual signalling), and the pursuit predation hypothesis for Spinosaurus as a “highly specialized aquatic predator” is not supported. In contrast, a ‘wading’ model for an animal that predominantly fished from shorelines or within shallow waters is not contradicted by any line of evidence and is well supported. Spinosaurus almost certainly fed primarily from the water and may have swum, but there is no evidence that it was a specialised aquatic pursuit predator.},

Examples of bone exploitation by carnivorous theropod dinosaurs are relatively rare, representing an apparent waste of both mineral and energetic resources. A review of the known incidences and possible ecological implications of theropod bone use concludes that there is currently no definitive evidence supporting the regular deliberate ingestion of bone by these predators. However, further investigation is required as the small bones of juvenile dinosaurs missing from the fossil record may be absent as a result of theropods preferentially hunting and consuming juveniles. We discuss implications for both hunting and feeding in theropods based on the existing data. We conclude that, like modern predators, theropods preferentially hunted and ate juvenile animals leading to the absence of small, and especially young, dinosaurs in the fossil record. The traditional view of large theropods hunting the adults of large or giant dinosaur species is therefore considered unlikely and such events rare. □Behaviour, carnivory, palaeoecology, predation, resource utilization.},

Fossilized evidence of direct trophic interactions between tetrapods is rare, whether the interactions involve predation or scavenging. Typically this evidence is limited to preserved stomach contents or bite marks on bones (when they can be confidently attributed to specific taxa) that make it possible to begin to piece together the trophic webs that existed in ancient ecosystems. The dramatic ‘fighting dinosaurs’ fossil of a Velociraptor preserved in combat with a Protoceratops provides an outstanding, but still lone, example of the two taxa interacting. Here new evidence of a Velociraptor feeding on the carcass of a Protoceratops is presented, based on tooth-marked bones of the latter that were found in association with shed teeth of the former in Upper Cretaceous deposits at Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia, China. In contrast to the case of the fighting dinosaurs, which seems to represent active predation by a Velociraptor, the tooth marks on the Bayan Mandahu material are inferred to have been produced during late-stage carcass consumption either during scavenging or following a group kill. Feeding by Velociraptor upon Protoceratops was probably a relatively common occurrence.},

Their relatively small sample sizes, long growth periods, and difficulties distinguishing the sexes of fossil specimens mean that there are little compelling data on dimorphism in these animals. The extant gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is a large and endangered crocodylian that is sexually dimorphic in size, but males also possesses a sexually selected structure, the ghara, which has an osteological correlate in the presence of a fossa associated with the nares. This makes the species a unique model for potentially assessing dimorphism in fossil lineages, such as dinosaurs and pterosaurs, because it is a large, slow-growing, egg-laying archosaur. Here we assess the dimorphism of G. gangeticus across 106 specimens and show that the presence of a narial fossa diagnoses adult male gharials. Males are larger than females, but the level of size dimorphism, and that of other cranial features, is low and difficult to detect without a priori knowledge of the sexes, even with this large dataset. By extension, dimorphism in extinct reptiles is very difficult to detect in the absence of sex specific characters, such as the narial fossa.},

While multifunctionality for many such structures is probable given extant analogues, invoking species recognition as the primary selective mechanism driving the evolution of such structures is problematic given the lack of evidence for this in extant species. Furthermore, some of the evidence presented does not support the hypothesis as claimed or is equivocal or erroneous. Suggestions that certain evolutionary patterns of diversification in these exaggerated structures are indicative of a role in species recognition are unreliable, as both a degree of phylogenetic directionality and of randomness are seen in extant species where similar structures function in sexual selection. Claims that an absence of sexual dimorphism in the exaggerated structures of non-avialan dinosaurs rule against a role in sexual selection ignores the possible existence of mutual sexual selection and is also sometimes limited in view of sample sizes. The suggestion that the existence of species recognition is supported by the presence of exaggerated structures in sympatric, closely related relatives is also erroneous because adorned dinosaur species sometimes exist in the absence of unadorned relatives. We conclude that species recognition was not the evolutionary mechanism most likely to be driving the appearance and persistence of exaggerated structures in non-avialan dinosaurs.},

Though a range of ages (15–25 years) was found for the specimens studied, the seven individuals demonstrate that T. rex reached effectively full size in less than 20 years. The growth rate of T. rex was comparable to that of the African elephant, which has a similar mass and time to maturity.

  abstract = {Background A dinosaur census recorded during the Hell Creek Project (1999–2009) incorporates multiple lines of evidence from geography, taphohistory, stratigraphy, phylogeny and ontogeny to investigate the relative abundance of large dinosaurs preserved in the Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation of northeastern Montana, USA. Overall, the dinosaur skeletal assemblages in the Hell Creek Formation (excluding lag-influenced records) consist primarily of subadult or small adult size individuals. Small juveniles and large adults are both extremely rare, whereas subadult individuals are relatively common. We propose that mature individuals of at least some dinosaur taxa either lived in a separate geographic locale analogous to younger individuals inhabiting an upland environment where sedimentation rates were relatively less, or these taxa experienced high mortality before reaching terminal size where late stage and often extreme cranial morphology is expressed. Methodology/Principal Findings Tyrannosaurus skeletons are as abundant as Edmontosaurus, an herbivore, in the upper Hell Creek Formation and nearly twice as common in the lower third of the formation. Smaller, predatory dinosaurs (e.g., Troodon and dromaeosaurids) are primarily represented by teeth found in microvertebrate localities and their skeletons or identifiable lag specimens were conspicuously absent. This relative abundance suggests Tyrannosaurus was not a typical predator and likely benefited from much wider food choice opportunities than exclusively live prey and/or specific taxa. Tyrannosaurus adults may not have competed with Tyrannosaurus juveniles if the potential for selecting carrion increased with size during ontogeny. Conclusions/Significance Triceratops is the most common dinosaur and isolated skulls contribute to a significant portion of this census. Associated specimens of Triceratops consisting of both cranial and postcranial elements remain relatively rare. This rarity may be explained by a historical collecting bias influenced by facies and taphonomic factors. The limited discovery of postcranial elements may also depend on how extensive a fossil quarry is expanded after a skull is collected.},

Collaborative case studies further enrich students’ learning and provide experience to solve open-ended applied problems. The course has an emphasis on undergraduate research, where accessible academic journal articles are read, discussed, and critiqued in class. With increased confidence and familiarity, students take the challenge of reading, implementing, and sometimes extending methods in journal articles for their course projects.

  abstract = {Many hypotheses have been proposed for the rise of dinosaurs, but their early diversification remains poorly understood. This paper examines the occurrences, species diversity and abundance of early dinosaurs at both regional and global scales to determine patterns of their early evolutionary history. Four main patterns are clear: (1) sauropodomorph dinosaurs became abundant during the late Norian–Rhaetian of Gondwana and Europe; (2) Triassic dinosaurs of North America have low species diversity and abundance until the beginning of the Jurassic; (3) sauropodomorphs and ornithischians are absent in the Triassic of North America; and (4) ornithischian dinosaurs maintain low species diversity, relative abundance and small body size until the Early Jurassic. No one hypothesis fully explains these data. There is no evidence for a Carnian–Norian extinction event, but sauropodomorphs did become abundant during the Norian in some assemblages. No clear connection exists between palaeoenvironment and early dinosaur diversity, but environmental stress at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary is consistent with changes in North American dinosaur assemblages. Elevated growth rates in dinosaurs are consistent with the gradual phyletic increase in body size. This study demonstrates that early dinosaur diversification was a complex process that was geographically diachronous and probably had several causes.},

Indirect evidence from bonebeds, trackways, nesting traces and in-group comparisons with extant Archosauria suggests that the only substantive arguments to be made for dinosaur sociality concern cranial ornamentation and herding behaviour. There is currently no reliable method to determine gender from skeletal remains. Dinosaur reproductive anatomy was a unique combination of crocodilian and avian characters and extant models indicate that dinosaurs copulated using a reptilian ‘leg over back’ posture. Reliable evidence for post-hatching care in dinosaurs is lacking and extant archosaurs yield little insight. A hypothesis is proposed that for the majority of dinosaurs there was no post-hatching care provided which would have allowed adults energy acquisition that would otherwise have been required for defence and provisioning to be redirected towards growth and increased fecundity, both traits for which there is fossil evidence. Arguments suggesting that the more advanced aspects of extant avian care boasting an explicit coelurosaurian theropod origin are rejected as these behaviours appear unique to the Neornithes. Three ancestral care hypotheses are tested and none conform in a satisfactory manner with body fossil and ichnological evidence.},

Although similar in absolute size and in virtually all other anatomical details, the anterior haemal spines of MPC-D 100/1002 exceed those of MPC-D 100/1127 in ventral depth and develop a hitherto unreported “spearhead” shape. This dissimilarity cannot be readily explained as pathologic and is too extreme to be reasonably attributed to the amount of individual variation expected among con-specifics. Instead, this discrepancy in haemal spine morphology may be attributable to sexual dimorphism. The haemal spine form of MPC-D 100/1002 offers greater surface area for caudal muscle insertions. On this basis, MPC-D 100/1002 is regarded as most probably male and MPC-D 100/1127 is regarded as most probably female.},

  abstract = {Mass extinctions have played many evolutionary roles, involving  differential survivorship or selectivity of taxa and traits, the  disruption or preservation of evolutionary trends and ecosystem  organization, and the promotion of taxonomic and morphological  diversifications—often along unexpected trajectories—after the  destruction or marginalization of once-dominant clades. The fossil  record suggests that survivorship during mass extinctions is not  strictly random, but it often fails to coincide with factors promoting  survival during times of low extinction intensity. Although of very  serious concern, present-day extinctions have not yet achieved the  intensities seen in the Big Five mass extinctions of the geologic past,  which each removed ≥50\% of the subset of relatively abundant marine  invertebrate genera. The best comparisons for predictive purposes  therefore will involve factors such as differential extinction  intensities among regions, clades, and functional groups, rules  governing postextinction biotic interchanges and evolutionary dynamics,  and analyses of the factors that cause taxa and evolutionary trends to  continue unabated, to suffer setbacks but resume along the same  trajectory, to survive only to fall into a marginal role or disappear  (“dead clade walking”), or to undergo a burst of diversification.  These issues need to be addressed in a spatially explicit framework,  because the fossil record suggests regional differences in  postextinction diversification dynamics and biotic interchanges.  Postextinction diversifications lag far behind the initial taxonomic  and morphological impoverishment and homogenization; they do not simply  reoccupy vacated adaptive peaks, but explore opportunities as opened  and constrained by intrinsic biotic factors and the ecological and  evolutionary context of the radiation.},

However, empirical evidence for a positive relationship between sexual selection on males and male-biased SSD received mixed support depending on the studied taxonomic group and on the method used to quantify sexual selection. Here, we present a meta-analytic approach accounting for phylogenetic non-independence to test how standardized metrics of the opportunity and strength of pre-copulatory sexual selection relate to SSD across a broad range of animal taxa comprising up to 95 effect sizes from 59 species. We found that SSD based on length measurements was correlated with the sex difference in the opportunity for sexual selection but showed a weak and statistically non-significant relationship with the sex difference in the Bateman gradient. These findings suggest that pre-copulatory sexual selection plays a limited role for the evolution of SSD in a broad phylogenetic context.},

  abstract = {Following an idea originally expressed by Björn Kurtén (1953), we here investigate the notion that differences in the scaling of reproductive output could be responsible (at least in part) for the differences in body sizes (both mean and maximum) attained by dinosaurs and terrestrial mammals. Using terrestrial non-passerine birds as "dinosaur analogs" we show that birds exhibit little or no decline in a variety of reproductive life history parameters with increasing body size, in contrast to terrestrial mammals. Extending this argument to dinosaurs, we suggest that large dinosaurs would have had a greater potential for reproductive turnover than similarly sized mammals and would thus have had a much greater capacity for rebuilding populations following environmental perturbations. This difference in reproductive strategies, which has its basis in ovoparity (dinosaur) versus viviparity plus lactation (mammals), may have resulted in a differential in the ability for dinosaurs and mammals to evolve and sustain largebodied species over evolutionary time. We also compare terrestrial mammals to cetaceans and show that marine mammals show a lesser decline in the scaling of reproductive output with body size. We suggest that differences in the costs of gestation and lactation, related to the richer available diet in the marine environment, may in part explain the greater sizes obtained by marine mammals in comparison to terrestrial ones.},

  abstract = {Two major evolutionary events in the early history of Mesozoic marine reptiles have been recorded in the Triassic of China. The first event evidenced by the Early Triassic Chaohu Fauna was the emergence of new marine communities and their subsequent radiation in the Spathian Subage of the late Olenekian (Early Triassic). The earliest marine reptile fossil horizon was found to be 248.81~Ma in age, therefore about 3.35 myr after the end-Permian mass extinction. The emergence time for the clade Ichthyosauromorpha has been suggested to be between 251.5 and 248.8~Ma. Moreover, the first occurrence of this clade is not thought to have been prior to the end-Permian mass extinction and this is therefore indicative of an exceptionally high evolutionary rate. Globally, twenty eight marine reptile species (six from Chaohu) have been recorded in an interval of just 2 myr in the Early Triassic, and these marine reptiles diversified and became the predators in the Mesozoic marine ecosystems that formed soon after the end-Permian mass extinction. The first event was followed by a transition from coastal to oceanic communities followed by selective disappearance of coastal species and emergence of oceanic species in the Ladinian of the Middle Triassic, as evidenced by the Xingyi Fauna. Here a 5.1~m thick fossiliferous unit yields 17 or more taxa of marine reptiles and can be subdivided into two separate assemblages. The lower assemblage is mainly composed of nearshore sauropterygians, close to that of the Anisian Panxian Fauna and with a strong palaeobiogeographic affinity to western Tethys. In the upper assemblage, the coastal pachypleurosaurian and nothosaurian sauropterygians disappear, to be replaced by the large ichthyosaurs and pistosaurs with a closer palaeobiogeographic affinity to Panthalassa. In this assemblage, there is an example of an ichthyosaur unequivocally feeding on another marine reptile. This is the oldest definitive record of a marine reptile acting as an apex predator. The transition from the lower assemblage to the upper one also records a turnover of Mesozoic marine reptiles from coastal to oceanic forms, and from a strong west Tethyan affinity to an assemblage showing a greater affinity with east Panthalassa by the late Middle Triassic.},

  abstract = {The open-source programming language ‘R' has become a standard tool in the palaeobiologist's toolkit. Its popularity within the palaeobiological community continues to grow, with published articles increasingly citing the usage of R and R packages. However, there are currently a lack of agreed standards for data preparation and available frameworks to support the implementation of such standards. Consequently, data preparation workflows are often unclear and not reproducible, even when code is provided. Moreover, due to a lack of code accessibility and documentation, palaeobiologists are often forced to ‘reinvent the wheel’ to find solutions to issues already solved by other members of the community. Here, we introduce palaeoverse, a community-driven R package to aid data preparation and exploration for quantitative palaeobiological research. The package is freely available and has three core principles: (1) streamline data preparation and analyses; (2) enhance code readability; and (3) improve reproducibility of results. To develop these aims, we assessed the analytical needs of the broader palaeobiological community using an online survey, in addition to incorporating our own experiences. In this work, we first report the findings of the survey, which shaped the development of the package. Subsequently, we describe and demonstrate the functionality available in palaeoverse and provide usage examples. Finally, we discuss the resources we have made available for the community and our future plans for the broader Palaeoverse project. palaeoverse is a community-driven R package for palaeobiology, developed with the intention of bringing palaeobiologists together to establish agreed standards for high-quality quantitative research. The package provides a user-friendly platform for preparing data for analysis with well-documented open-source code to enhance transparency. The functionality available in palaeoverse improves code reproducibility and accessibility, which is beneficial for both the review process and future research.},

  abstract = {A core tradition of HCI lies in the experimental evaluation of the effects of techniques and interfaces to determine if they are useful for achieving their purpose. However, our individual analyses tend to stand alone, and study results rarely accrue in more precise estimates via meta-analysis: in a literature search, we found only 56 meta-analyses in HCI in the ACM Digital Library, 3 of which were published at CHI (often called the top HCI venue). Yet meta-analysis is the gold standard for demonstrating robust quantitative knowledge. We treat this as a user-centered design problem: the failure to accrue quantitative knowledge is not the users’ (i.e. researchers’) failure, but a failure to consider those users’ needs when designing statistical practice. Using simulation, we compare hypothetical publication worlds following existing frequentist against Bayesian practice. We show that Bayesian analysis yields more precise effects with each new study, facilitating knowledge accrual without traditional meta-analyses. Bayesian practices also allow more principled conclusions from small-n studies of novel techniques. These advantages make Bayesian practices a likely better fit for the culture and incentives of the field. Instead of admonishing ourselves to spend resources on larger studies, we propose using tools that more appropriately analyze small studies and encourage knowledge accrual from one study to the next. We also believe Bayesian methods can be adopted from the bottom up without the need for new incentives for replication or meta-analysis. These techniques offer the potential for a more user- (i.e. researcher-) centered approach to statistical analysis in HCI.},

The fossil record provides a means of testing these predictions, but detecting its signature from morphological data alone is difficult. There are, nonetheless, some specific patterns of growth and variation which are expected of traits under socio-sexual selection. The distinctive parietal-squamosal frill of ceratopsian dinosaurs has previously been suggested as a socio-sexual display trait, but evidence for this has been limited. Here, we perform a whole-skull shape analysis of an unprecedentedly large sample of specimens of Protoceratops andrewsi using a high-density landmark-based geometric morphometric approach to test four predictions regarding a potential socio-sexual signalling role for the frill. Three predictions—low integration with the rest of the skull, significantly higher rate of change in size and shape during ontogeny, and higher morphological variance than other skull regions—are supported. One prediction, sexual dimorphism in shape, is not supported, suggesting that sexual differences in P. andrewsi are likely to be small. Together, these findings are consistent with mutual mate choice or selection for signalling quality in more general social interactions, and support the hypothesis that the frill functioned as a socio-sexual signal in ceratopsian dinosaurs.},

Although testing hypotheses based on sexual selection can be difficult, especially given that there is no single, reliable means of recognising sexual selection, we argue that it is not impossible; indeed, there are now several cases where sexual selection is strongly supported. In other cases, a careful study of features such as sexual dimorphism, ontogeny, and allometry, coupled with testing of alternative hypotheses, will be necessary to distinguish between possible explanations for exaggerated features.},

This unusual extinction of large and slow-breeding animals provides some of the strongest support for a human contribution to their extinction and is consistent with various human hunting models, but it is difficult to explain by models relying solely on environmental change. It is an oversimplification, however, to say that a wave of hunting-induced extinctions swept continents immediately after first human contact. Results from recent studies suggest that humans precipitated extinction in many parts of the globe through combined direct (hunting) and perhaps indirect (competition, habitat alteration) impacts, but that the timing and geography of extinction might have been different and the worldwide magnitude less, had not climatic change coincided with human impacts in many places.},

  author = {Ko, Krzysztof},
  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism can provide information on behavioral and ecological characteristics of extinct species. However, estimation of sexual dimorphism becomes very difficult, as identification of sex in skeletal specimens is often impossible. Several methods have been developed to estimate dimorphism from unsexed data: mean method, median method, finite mixture analysis (FMA), method of moments (MoM), binomial dimorphism index (BDI), coefficient of variation (CV) method, and assigned resampling method (ARM). We tested the methods using computer-generated samples of given size and having “descended” from virtual populations of strictly defined parameters. The analysis showed that precision of estimating sexual dimorphism was affected by small sample size, unbalanced sex ratio, and increased intrasexual CV (but not by skewness). Mean and CV methods turned out to be the best ones in most circumstances. CV is the best method when within-sex CV value is assumed accurately. In conditions of low within-sex CV (about 5\%) and large sample size (about 50 or more) MoM proved to be the best method. However, in most situations, the error of estimation resulted mainly from sampling error, not from the error of method, so we believe that rather than seeking new methods or improving existing ones, one should accept the impossibility of precise estimation of sexual dimorphism from unsexed fossil samples.},

  abstract = {The ecogeographic rule known as Bergmann's rule suggests that there is a positive relationship between body size and latitude when comparing closely related taxa. The underlying mechanism or mechanisms to explain this pattern vary as widely as the taxa that seem to follow it, which has led to skepticism over whether Bergmann's rule should be considered a rule at all. Despite this, Bergmann's rule is widespread among modern birds, mammals, beetles, and some amphibians, but far fewer extinct taxa have been subjected to tests of Bergmann's rule. To examine whether Bergmann's rule is detected in extinct taxa, we compared body-size proxies in Lystrosaurus recovered from Early Triassic–aged strata in Antarctica, South Africa, India, and China. Our results reveal that average body size is largest at mid-northern paleolatitudes (\textasciitilde 45°N) instead of the highest southern paleolatitudes (\textasciitilde 70°S). Additionally, maximum body size is consistent across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, indicating that Bergmann's rule did not apply for Lystrosaurus during the Early Triassic. To test potential sample size biases in our results, we used rarefaction and subsampling to show that only the Karoo Basin is well sampled and that large individuals are exceedingly rare, except in the Turpan-Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, China. Taken together, our results suggest that Lystrosaurus had the potential to reach large body sizes in each of the latitudinally widespread geologic basins studied here, but that local conditions may have allowed individuals at mid-northern paleolatitudes a greater chance of reaching a large size compared with southern congeners that suffered increased mortality when young or at a small size.},

  abstract = {The oldest unequivocal records of Dinosauria were unearthed from Late Triassic rocks (approximately 230 Ma) accumulated over extensional rift basins in southwestern Pangea. The better known of these are Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, Pisanosaurus mertii, Eoraptor lunensis, and Panphagia protos from the Ischigualasto Formation, Argentina, and Staurikosaurus pricei and Saturnalia tupiniquim from the Santa Maria Formation, Brazil. No uncontroversial dinosaur body fossils are known from older strata, but the Middle Triassic origin of the lineage may be inferred from both the footprint record and its sister-group relation to Ladinian basal dinosauromorphs. These include the typical Marasuchus lilloensis, more basal forms such as Lagerpeton and Dromomeron, as well as silesaurids: a possibly monophyletic group composed of Mid-Late Triassic forms that may represent immediate sister taxa to dinosaurs. The first phylogenetic definition to fit the current understanding of Dinosauria as a node-based taxon solely composed of mutually exclusive Saurischia and Ornithischia was given as “all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of birds and Triceratops”. Recent cladistic analyses of early dinosaurs agree that Pisanosaurus mertii is a basal ornithischian; that Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis and Staurikosaurus pricei belong in a monophyletic Herrerasauridae; that herrerasaurids, Eoraptor lunensis, and Guaibasaurus candelariensis are saurischians; that Saurischia includes two main groups, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda; and that Saturnalia tupiniquim is a basal member of the sauropodomorph lineage. On the contrary, several aspects of basal dinosaur phylogeny remain controversial, including the position of herrerasaurids, E. lunensis, and G. candelariensis as basal theropods or basal saurischians, and the affinity and/or validity of more fragmentary taxa such as Agnosphitys cromhallensis, Alwalkeria maleriensis, Chindesaurus bryansmalli, Saltopus elginensis, and Spondylosoma absconditum. The identification of dinosaur apomorphies is jeopardized by the incompleteness of skeletal remains attributed to most basal dinosauromorphs, the skulls and forelimbs of which are particularly poorly known. Nonetheless, Dinosauria can be diagnosed by a suite of derived traits, most of which are related to the anatomy of the pelvic girdle and limb. Some of these are connected to the acquisition of a fully erect bipedal gait, which has been traditionally suggested to represent a key adaptation that allowed, or even promoted, dinosaur radiation during Late Triassic times. Yet, contrary to the classical “competitive” models, dinosaurs did not gradually replace other terrestrial tetrapods over the Late Triassic. In fact, the radiation of the group comprises at least three landmark moments, separated by controversial (Carnian-Norian, Triassic-Jurassic) extinction events. These are mainly characterized by early diversification in Carnian times, a Norian increase in diversity and (especially) abundance, and the occupation of new niches from the Early Jurassic onwards. Dinosaurs arose from fully bipedal ancestors, the diet of which may have been carnivorous or omnivorous. Whereas the oldest dinosaurs were geographically restricted to south Pangea, including rare ornithischians and more abundant basal members of the saurischian lineage, the group achieved a nearly global distribution by the latest Triassic, especially with the radiation of saurischian groups such as “prosauropods” and coelophysoids.},

  abstract = {The faunal assemblage from the early Maastrichtian portion of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is described on the basis of four new vertebrate microfossil localities and remains from the Albertosaurus bonebed. All of the localities sampled were deposited during a cool, dry climate at a palaeolatitude of ∼58°N. Thus, these assemblages provide insight into a northern cool-climate assemblage in the early Maastrichtian of western North America. This fauna is characterized by the presence of taxa with more northern affinities, such as Holostean A, champsosaurs, Troodon, and toothed birds. Warm-climate taxa, such as crocodylians, large and diverse turtles, and albanerpetontids are notable in their absence. The Albertosaurus bonebed locality at the top of unit 4 of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was deposited during the initial stages of a trend to a warmer and wetter climate that is represented in unit 5. The bonebed shares many taxa with the underlying vertebrate microfossil localities. However, a notable difference is the presence of Atrociraptor marshalli from the Albertosaurus bonebed but not the other localities in the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The presence of Atrociraptor may be attributable to this change in climate rather than local ecological conditions. Also, the assemblages are different in the paucity of fish remains in the bonebed, and the relative rarity of shed hadrosaur teeth. The low abundance of aquatic taxa and rarity of shed teeth of hadrosaurs indicate that the locality is largely autochthonous, with little material being transported into the site.},

  abstract = {Recent histological studies suggest relatively rapid growth in dinosaurs. However, the timing of reproductive maturity (RM) in dinosaurs is poorly known because unambiguous indicators of RM are rare. One exception is medullary bone (MB), which is an ephemeral bony tissue that forms before ovulation in the marrow cavities of birds as a calcium source for eggshelling. Recently, MB also was described in a single specimen of the saurischian dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex. Here, we report two other occurrences of MB: in another saurischian dinosaur, Allosaurus, and in the ornithischian dinosaur Tenontosaurus. We show by counting lines of arrested growth and performing growth curve reconstructions that Tenontosaurus, Allosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus were reproductively mature by 8, 10, and 18 years, respectively. RM in these dinosaurs coincided with a transition from growth acceleration to deceleration. It also far precedes predictions based on the growth rates of living reptiles scaled to similar size. Despite relatively rapid growth, dinosaurs were similar to reptiles in that RM developed before reaching asymptotic size. However, this reproductive strategy also occurs in medium- to large-sized mammals and correlates with a strategy of prolonged multiyear growth. RM in actively growing individuals suggests that these dinosaurs were born relatively precocial and experienced high adult mortality. The origin of the modern avian reproductive strategy in ornithuran birds likely coincided with their extreme elevations in growth rate and truncations to growth duration.},

  abstract = {Turning large dinosaurs into small birds                            Most paleontologists agree that birds are descended from dinosaurs. How did such large terrestrial or aquatic animals evolve into small feathered fliers? Lee               et al.               used two large databases of theropod morphology to explore possible evolutionary patterns that may have driven this dramatic transformation (see the Perspective by Benton). They found no clear pattern of miniaturization across the entire clade of Theropoda. However, several lines of evidence suggested that the lineage leading to birds underwent sustained miniaturization. Within that lineage, body sizes decreased and species evolved faster. They also developed ecological and morphological innovations linked to smaller body sizes.

[Also see Perspective by                 Benton                 ]                                       ,              Recent discoveries have highlighted the dramatic evolutionary transformation of massive, ground-dwelling theropod dinosaurs into light, volant birds. Here, we apply Bayesian approaches (originally developed for inferring geographic spread and rates of molecular evolution in viruses) in a different context: to infer size changes and rates of anatomical innovation (across up to 1549 skeletal characters) in fossils. These approaches identify two drivers underlying the dinosaur-bird transition. The theropod lineage directly ancestral to birds undergoes sustained miniaturization across 50 million years and at least 12 consecutive branches (internodes) and evolves skeletal adaptations four times faster than other dinosaurs. The distinct, prolonged phase of miniaturization along the bird stem would have facilitated the evolution of many novelties associated with small body size, such as reorientation of body mass, increased aerial ability, and paedomorphic skulls with reduced snouts but enlarged eyes and brains.},

We compare large-scale macroevolutionary patterns in these transitions across the three major amphibian clades: frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. We analyse matching reproductive and phylogenetic data for 4025 species. We find that having aquatic larvae is ancestral for all three groups and is retained by many extant species (33–44\%). The most frequent transitions in each group are to relatively uncommon states: live-bearing in caecilians, paedomorphosis in salamanders, and semi-terrestriality in frogs. All three groups show transitions to more terrestrial reproductive modes, but only in caecilians have these evolved sequentially from most-to-least aquatic. Diversification rates are largely independent of reproductive modes. However, in salamanders direct development accelerates diversification whereas paedomorphosis decreases it. Overall, we find a widespread retention of ancestral modes, decoupling of trait transition rates from patterns of species richness, and the general independence of reproductive modes and diversification.},

Ichthyosaurs as K-strategists (reproductive) were under greater stress from the fast-swimming bony fishes (r-strategists) and sharks. A connection between ichthyosaur extinction and the extinction of belemnites is refuted on the basis of feeding strategies in present-day dolphins and whales.

  abstract = {The rapid and accurate taxonomic identification of fossils is of great significance in paleontology, biostratigraphy, and other fields. However, taxonomic identification is often labor-intensive and tedious, and the requisition of extensive prior knowledge about a taxonomic group also requires long-term training. Moreover, identification results are often inconsistent across researchers and communities. Accordingly, in this study, we used deep learning to support taxonomic identification. We used web crawlers to collect the Fossil Image Dataset (FID) via the Internet, obtaining 415,339 images belonging to 50 fossil clades. Then we trained three powerful convolutional neural networks on a high-performance workstation. The Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture achieved an average accuracy of 0.90 in the test dataset when transfer learning was applied. The clades of microfossils and vertebrate fossils exhibited the highest identification accuracies of 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. In contrast, clades of sponges, bryozoans, and trace fossils with various morphologies or with few samples in the dataset exhibited a performance below 0.80. Visual explanation methods further highlighted the discrepancies among different fossil clades and suggested similarities between the identifications made by machine classifiers and taxonomists. Collecting large paleontological datasets from various sources, such as the literature, digitization of dark data, citizen-science data, and public data from the Internet may further enhance deep learning methods and their adoption. Such developments will also possibly lead to image-based systematic taxonomy to be replaced by machine-aided classification in the future. Pioneering studies can include microfossils and some invertebrate fossils. To contribute to this development, we deployed our model on a server for public access at www.ai-fossil.com.},

  abstract = {The observed diversity of dinosaurs reached its highest peak during the mid- and Late Cretaceous, the 50{$\mkern1mu$}Myr that preceded their extinction, and yet this explosion of dinosaur diversity may be explained largely by sampling bias. It has long been debated whether dinosaurs were part of the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (KTR), from 125–80{$\mkern1mu$}Myr ago, when flowering plants, herbivorous and social insects, squamates, birds and mammals all underwent a rapid expansion. Although an apparent explosion of dinosaur diversity occurred in the mid-Cretaceous, coinciding with the emergence of new groups (e.g. neoceratopsians, ankylosaurid ankylosaurs, hadrosaurids and pachycephalosaurs), results from the first quantitative study of diversification applied to a new supertree of dinosaurs show that this apparent burst in dinosaurian diversity in the last 18 Myr of the Cretaceous is a sampling artefact. Indeed, major diversification shifts occurred largely in the first one-third of the group's history. Despite the appearance of new clades of medium to large herbivores and carnivores later in dinosaur history, these new originations do not correspond to significant diversification shifts. Instead, the overall geometry of the Cretaceous part of the dinosaur tree does not depart from the null hypothesis of an equal rates model of lineage branching. Furthermore, we conclude that dinosaurs did not experience a progressive decline at the end of the Cretaceous, nor was their evolution driven directly by the KTR.},

Application of the model to the three main clades of dinosaurs suggests that much of their diversity fluctuations cannot be explained by sampling alone. Furthermore, there is new support for a long-term decline in their diversity leading up to the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event. At present, use of this method with data that includes either Lagerstätten or ‘Pull of the Recent’ biases is inappropriate, although partial solutions are offered.},

Here we describe a bizarre new plioplatecarpine mosasaurid, Khinjaria acuta, characterized by enlarged, dagger-like anterior teeth, short, robust jaws, and posterior elongation of the skull. Khinjaria is related to Goronyosaurus nigeriensis from Nigeria and Niger, and Gavialimimus almaghribensis from Morocco. These species form a distinct clade of specialized mosasaurids so far unknown outside of Africa. Mosasaurids show high endemism in the Maastrichtian, with different lineages occurring in different regions, implying that mosasaurid diversity is underestimated because of limited geographic sampling. The large size, robust jaws, akinetic skull, and bladelike teeth of Khinjaria suggest it was an apex predator, but the unusual skull and jaw differ from those of contemporary predators like Hainosaurus, Thalassotitan, and Mosasaurus, suggesting a distinct feeding strategy. Mosasaurids became increasingly specialized in the latest Cretaceous, repeatedly evolving to occupy the apex predator niche, suggesting a diverse marine ecosystem persisted up to the K-Pg boundary. Late Cretaceous marine ecosystems differ from modern marine ecosystems in the high diversity of large predators.},

An ongoing debate concerns the validity of Nanotyrannus lancensis, interpreted either as a distinct genus of small-bodied tyrannosaur or a juvenile of Tyrannosaurus rex. We examine multiple lines of evidence and show that the evidence strongly supports recognition of Nanotyrannus as a distinct species for the following reasons: 1. High diversity of tyrannosaurs and predatory dinosaurs supports the idea that multiple tyrannosaurids inhabited the late Maastrichtian of Laramidia; 2. Nanotyrannus lacks characters supporting referral to Tyrannosaurus or Tyrannosaurinae but differs from T. rex in {$>$}150 morphological characters, while intermediate forms combining the features of Nanotyrannus and T. rex are unknown; 3. Histology shows specimens of Nanotyrannus showing (i) skeletal fusions, (ii) mature skull bone textures, (iii) slow growth rates relative to T. rex, (iv) decelerating growth in their final years of life, and (v) growth curves predicting adult masses of \textasciitilde 1500 kg or less, showing these animals are subadults and young adults, not juvenile Tyrannosaurus; 4. growth series of other tyrannosaurids, including Tarbosaurus and Gorgosaurus, do not show morphological changes proposed for a Nanotyrannus–Tyrannosaurus growth series, and deriving Tyrannosaurus from Nanotyrannus requires several changes inconsistent with known patterns of dinosaur development; 5. Juvenile T. rex exist, showing diagnostic features of Tyrannosaurus; 6. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Nanotyrannus may lie outside Tyrannosauridae. Tyrannosaur diversity before the K-Pg extinction is higher than previously appreciated. The challenges inherent in diagnosing species based on fossils mean paleontologists may be systematically underestimating the diversity of ancient ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity has changed through time and space is a central aim of paleobiology. To elucidate accurate biodiversity patterns in deep time, regional case studies, where sampling biases can be minimized, are needed. The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the western U.S.A. crops out over 1.2 million km2 and covers 12° of latitude. It was deposited over a ∼9-million-year time period, and was home to some of the most iconic dinosaurs. Utilizing a new, high resolution chronostratigraphic framework for the formation, tetrapod occurrences from the Paleobiology Database were temporally and spatially mapped to examine patterns of diversity change through time and space, and the geographic ranges of taxa were examined to shed light on niche partitioning. Latitudinally, diversity was found to peak in the center of the basin, perhaps due to the availability of water resources. Diversity increased over time in the Morrison Formation, and there is no evidence to indicate a decline in diversity prior to the extinction of the fauna at the end of the Jurassic. There appears to be some degree of geographic separation of faunas in the Morrison basin, with a southeastern and northwestern fauna, albeit with a number of overlapping taxa. High resolution climate models paired with detailed sedimentological analysis could help to elucidate the drivers of the patterns observed here.},

  abstract = {Along the evolutionary continuum, a kaleidoscope of gas exchangers has evolved from the simple cell membrane of the primeval unicells. The most momentous events in this process were: the intensification of molecular oxygen in the biosphere and its appropriation into aerobic metabolism, the rise of multicellular organisms, the development of a circulatory system and carrier pigments in blood, the advocacy of air breathing, adoption of suctional breathing, and the shift to endothermy. To satisfy species-specific needs for oxygen, some constraints were overcome through transactions that obliged certain compromises and trade-offs. Optimal designs of the gas exchangers for particular phylogenetic levels of development, habitat, and lifestyle have developed only so far as to satisfy prescribed needs. The efficiency of the human lung, for example, falls well below those of certain taxa that are considered to be relatively “less advanced.” Utilizing different resources and strategies, in fascinating processes of conformity, different groups of animals have developed similar respiratory structures. In most cases, the analogy reflects evolutionary convergence in response to corresponding selective pressures rather than common ancestry.

  abstract = {Background Protoceratops andrewsi (Neoceratopsia, Protoceratopsidae) is a well-known dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. Some previous workers hypothesized sexual dimorphism in the cranial shape of this taxon, using qualitative and quantitative observations. In particular, width and height of the frill as well as the development of a nasal horn have been hypothesized as potentially sexually dimorphic. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we reassess potential sexual dimorphism in skulls of Protoceratops andrewsi by applying two-dimensional geometric morphometrics to 29 skulls in lateral and dorsal views. Principal Component Analyses and nonparametric MANOVAs recover no clear separation between hypothetical “males” and “females” within the overall morphospace. Males and females thus possess similar overall cranial morphologies. No differences in size between “males” and “females” are recovered using nonparametric ANOVAs. Conclusions/Significance Sexual dimorphism within Protoceratops andrewsi is not strongly supported by our results, as previously proposed by several authors. Anatomical traits such as height and width of the frill, and skull size thus may not be sexually dimorphic. Based on PCA for a data set focusing on the rostrum and associated ANOVA results, nasal horn height is the only feature with potential dimorphism. As a whole, most purported dimorphic variation is probably primarily the result of ontogenetic cranial shape changes as well as intraspecific cranial variation independent of sex.},

  abstract = {In marine ecosystems, fishing often targets predators, which can drive direct and indirect effects on entire food webs. Marine reserves can induce trophic cascades by increasing predator density and body size, thereby increasing predation pressure on populations of herbivores, such as sea urchins. In California's northern Channel Islands, two species of sea urchins are abundant: the red urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus, which is targeted by an economically valuable fishery, and the virtually unfished purple urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We hypothesized that urchin populations inside marine reserves would be depressed by higher predation, but that red urchins would be less affected due to fishing outside reserves. Instead, our analyses revealed that purple urchin populations were unaffected by reserves, and red urchin biomass significantly increased in response to protection. Therefore, urchin biomass overall has increased inside reserves, and we found no evidence that giant kelp is positively affected by reserves. Our results reveal the overwhelming direct effect of protecting fished species in marine reserves over indirect effects that are often predicted but seldom clearly documented. Indirect effects due to marine reserves may eventually occur in some cases, but very effective predators, large reserves or extended time periods may be needed to induce them.},

  abstract = {The demonstration of sexual dimorphism in the fossil record can provide vital information about the role that sexual selection has played in the evolution of life. However, statistically robust inferences of sexual dimorphism in fossil organisms are exceedingly difficult to establish, owing to issues of sample size, experimental control, and methodology. This is particularly so in the case of dinosaurs, for which sexual dimorphism has been posited in many species, yet quantifiable data are often lacking. This study presents the first statistical investigation of sexual dimorphism across Dinosauria. It revisits prior analyses that purport to find quantitative evidence for sexual dimorphism in nine dinosaur species. After the available morphological data were subjected to a suite of statistical tests (normality and unimodality tests and mixture modeling), no evidence for sexual dimorphism was found in any of the examined taxa, contrary to conventional wisdom. This is not to say that dinosaurs were not sexually dimorphic (phylogenetic inference suggests they may well have been), only that the available evidence precludes its detection. A priori knowledge of the sexes would greatly facilitate the assessment of sexual dimorphism in the fossil record, and it is suggested that unambiguous indicators of sex (e.g., presence of eggs, embryos, medullary bone) be used to this end.},

Tritylodontids are nonmammaliaform herbivorous cynodonts that originated in the Late Triassic epoch, diversified in the Jurassic period2–5 and survived into the Early Cretaceous epoch6,7. Eutriconodontans have generally been considered to be an extinct mammalian group, although different views exist8. Here we report a newly discovered tritylodontid and eutriconodontan from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China. Eutriconodontans are common in this biota9, but it was not previously known to contain tritylodontids. The two distantly related species show convergent features that are adapted for fossorial life, and are the first ‘scratch-diggers’ known from this biota. Both species also show an increased number of presacral vertebrae, relative to the ancestral state in synapsids or mammals10,11, that display meristic and homeotic changes. These fossils shed light on the evolutionary development of the axial skeleton in mammaliamorphs, which has been the focus of numerous studies in vertebrate evolution12–17 and developmental biology18–28. The phenotypes recorded by these fossils indicate that developmental plasticity in somitogenesis and HOX gene expression in the axial skeleton—similar to that observed in extant mammals—was already in place in stem mammaliamorphs. The interaction of these developmental mechanisms with natural selection may have underpinned the diverse phenotypes of body plan that evolved independently in various clades of mammaliamorph.},

  abstract = {,  Over 40~years ago, Raup and Sepkoski identified five episodes of elevated extinction in the marine fossil record that were thought to be statistically distinct, thus warranting the term the “Big Five” mass extinctions. Since then, the term has become part of standard vocabulary, especially with the naming of the current biodiversity crisis as the “sixth mass extinction.” However, there is no general agreement on which time intervals should be viewed as mass extinctions, in part because the Big Five turn out not to be statistically distinct from background rates of extinction, and in part, because other intervals of time have even higher extinction rates, in the Cambrian and early Ordovician. Nonetheless, the Big Five represent the five largest events since the early Ordovician, including in analyses that attempt to compensate for the incompleteness of the fossil and rock records. In the last 40~years, we have learned a great deal about the causes of many of the major and minor extinction events and are beginning to unravel the mechanisms that translated the initial environmental disturbances into extinction. However, for many of the events, further understanding will require going back to the outcrop, where the patchy distribution of environments and pervasive temporal gaps in the rock record challenge our ability to establish true extinction patterns. As for the current biodiversity crisis, there is no doubt that the rate of extinction is among the highest ever experienced by the biosphere, perhaps the second highest after the end-Cretaceous bolide impact. However (and fortunately), the absolute number of extinctions is still relatively small – there is still time to prevent this becoming a genuine mass extinction. Given the arbitrariness of calling out the Big Five, perhaps the current crisis should be called the “incipient Anthropocene mass extinction” rather than the “sixth mass extinction.”},

  abstract = {Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with one of the richest vertebrate fossil accumulations globally. The “badlands”-style topography exposes Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) meander-belt deposits of the Dinosaur Park Formation, providing an excellent opportunity for sedimentological and three-dimensional stratigraphic analysis. One of the main unknowns regarding the depositional environments of the Dinosaur Park Formation, specifically the proximity to the fluvial-to-marine transition zone, has been the subject of extensive debate. Our study aims to refine paleoenvironmental reconstructions of Late Cretaceous rivers through facies and facies associations analysis, meander-belt architecture characterization, and paleohydraulic parameter calculations. We investigate a\,\textasciitilde\,7\,m thick single-story meander-belt interval of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Six facies, four facies associations, and two architectural elements (both point bars) were identified from 20 stratigraphic sections. In addition, paleohydraulic reconstruction of the formative river channel was completed by estimating bankfull channel depth and width, paleoslope, and backwater length. Contrasting with previous interpretations of deposition (partially or wholly) influenced by tides, these data allow us to demonstrate that the meander-belt deposits of the Dinosaur Park Formation were deposited in a fluvial environment upstream of the fluvial-marine transition zone. Inclined heterolithic strata (IHS) present in the area are of fluvial origin, adding to the growing body of evidence for heterolithic bedding in fluvial point-bar environments. The newly inferred depositional setting for the studied portion of the Dinosaur Park Formation changes our understanding of the paleogeography of the Western Interior Seaway in western Canada and will allow paleontologists to revise the reconstructions of dinosaur habitats and better constrain the taphonomy of these globally significant fossil accumulations. Additionally, this study contributes to the validation and development of a systematic approach to the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of ancient river systems based on paleohydraulic analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Diet is a crucial trait of an animal’s lifestyle and ecology. The trophic level of an organism indicates its functional position within an ecosystem and holds significance for its ecology and evolution. Here, we demonstrate the use of zinc isotopes (δ               66               Zn) to geochemically assess the trophic level in diverse extant and extinct sharks, including the Neogene megatooth shark (               Otodus megalodon               ) and the great white shark (               Carcharodon carcharias               ). We reveal that dietary δ               66               Zn signatures are preserved in fossil shark tooth enameloid over deep geologic time and are robust recorders of each species’ trophic level. We observe significant δ               66               Zn differences among the               Otodus               and               Carcharodon               populations implying dietary shifts throughout the Neogene in both genera. Notably, Early Pliocene sympatric               C. carcharias               and               O. megalodon               appear to have occupied a similar mean trophic level, a finding that may hold clues to the extinction of the gigantic Neogene megatooth shark.},

  abstract = {Hyper-allometry, whereby an anatomical unit increases in size at a faster rate than other structures of the same organism, is considered to be an important feature of many sexually selected structures, with large ‘high-quality’ animals carrying a feature that is proportionally larger than smaller, ‘low-quality’ animals. When these structures are bilaterally symmetrical, it has been suggested that the degree of fluctuating asymmetry (deviation from perfect symmetry) acts as an indicator of the quality of the bearer. Bovids are useful models for testing sexual selection hypotheses due to their large horns and variety of reproductive systems. Here we use male and female specimens of the southern African blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) to assess the levels of allometry and fluctuating asymmetry in morphological features of the horns and skull. Males were found to be significantly larger than females for overall horn size, horn length and horn circumference and the horns were found to be isometric in both sexes. Directional asymmetry was found for horn length and horn circumference with the right being longer than the left side. These findings suggest that in C. taurinus the horns follow predicted patterns of variation for sexually selected traits, but that here fluctuating asymmetry may not be as important in sexual selection as previously suggested. Additionally, females did not differ greatly from males in variation and asymmetry and allometry, indicating their horns could be under sexual selection as a result of male choice, or that like males, they also engage in intraspecific combat as well.},

  abstract = {Background Fossil tracks made by non-avian theropod dinosaurs commonly reflect the habitual bipedal stance retained in living birds. Only rarely-captured behaviors, such as crouching, might create impressions made by the hands. Such tracks provide valuable information concerning the often poorly understood functional morphology of the early theropod forelimb. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a well-preserved theropod trackway in a Lower Jurassic (∼198 million-year-old) lacustrine beach sandstone in the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation in southwestern Utah. The trackway consists of prints of typical morphology, intermittent tail drags and, unusually, traces made by the animal resting on the substrate in a posture very similar to modern birds. The resting trace includes symmetrical pes impressions and well-defined impressions made by both hands, the tail, and the ischial callosity. Conclusions/Significance The manus impressions corroborate that early theropods, like later birds, held their palms facing medially, in contrast to manus prints previously attributed to theropods that have forward-pointing digits. Both the symmetrical resting posture and the medially-facing palms therefore evolved by the Early Jurassic, much earlier in the theropod lineage than previously recognized, and may characterize all theropods.},

Here, specimens ranging from Late Santonian to Late Maastrichtian in age are described and qualitatively categorized into morphotypes, most of which strongly resemble teeth of extant juvenile and some fossil crocodilians.

In order to obtain discriminatory criteria, an analysis BMDP (4M, 7M) on a sample of 66 Lower Cretaceous tridactyl footprints of diverse geographical origins has been carried out. The more significant ichnological parameters explaining sample variability are related with the digital widths and with the whole dimensions of the footprints. Some other parameters, such as digital angulation (often used as an important discriminatory criterion), seem to be of limited significance. Based on the more significant ichnological parameters, some indices have been proposed. These indices are used in bivariate analyses which allow to discriminate ornithopod from theropod footprints with a different degree of confidence.

  abstract = {Meta-analysis is increasingly used to synthesize major patterns in the large literatures within ecology and evolution. Meta-analytic methods that do not account for the process of observing data, which we may refer to as ‘informal meta-analyses’, may have undesirable properties. In some cases, informal meta-analyses may produce results that are unbiased, but do not necessarily make the best possible use of available data. In other cases, unbiased statistical noise in individual reports in the literature can potentially be converted into severe systematic biases in informal meta-analyses. I first present a general description of how failure to account for noise in individual inferences should be expected to lead to biases in some kinds of meta-analysis. In particular, informal meta-analyses of quantities that reflect the dispersion of parameters in nature, for example, the mean absolute value of a quantity, are likely to be generally highly misleading. I then re-analyse three previously published informal meta-analyses, where key inferences were of aspects of the dispersion of values in nature, for example, the mean absolute value of selection gradients. Major biological conclusions in each original informal meta-analysis closely match those that could arise as artefacts due to statistical noise. I present alternative mixed-model-based analyses that are specifically tailored to each situation, but where all analyses may be implemented with widely available open-source software. In each example meta-re-analysis, major conclusions change substantially.},

Marine reptiles were especially successful in the Mesozoic as major predators in the sea. There were more than a dozen groups of marine reptiles in the Mesozoic, of which four had more than 30 genera, namely sauropterygians (including plesiosaurs), ichthyopterygians, mosasaurs, and sea turtles. Medium-sized groups, such as Thalattosauria and Thalattosuchia, had about ten genera, whereas small groups, such as Hupehsuchia and Pleurosauridae, consisted of only two genera or less. Sauropterygia and Ichthyopterygia were the two longest surviving lineages, with 185 and 160 million years of stratigraphic spans, respectively. Mesozoic marine reptiles explored many different swimming styles and diets. Their diet included fish, cephalopods, other vertebrates, and hard-shelled invertebrates, whereas no herbivore is known at this point. Sauropterygians and ichthyopterygians gave rise to cruising forms that probably invaded outer seas. Intermediate forms that led to the cruising species are known in Ichthyopterygia but not as much in Sauropterygia. Discovery of new fossils should eventually reduce the gap in the fossil record.},

  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is a prevalent feature of sexually reproducing organisms yet its presence in dinosaurs has recently been questioned. However, the inferred absence of sexual dimorphism may be a methodological artefact, rooted in the lack of systematic knowledge concerning how sexual dimorphism of living animals behaves statistically. To start building such knowledge, I re-analysed published data of 139 species of living animals that are sexually dimorphic. The previous method used for dinosaurs recognized only 5\% of the living species correctly as dimorphic. This low rate is largely caused by the tilting of ordinated multivariate space due to interactions between size and shape dimorphisms, low signal/noise ratios and inclusion of outliers. The rate can be improved to 50\% by modifying the method but not further, unless the information on the sex of individual specimens is used. Such information is unavailable in dinosaurs, so sexual dimorphism probably cannot be established for a large proportion of sexually dimorphic dinosaurs. At the same time, about 32\% of the 139 are strongly sexually dimorphic, and can be re-sexed from shape with misclassification rates below 0.05. A reassessment of dinosaurian data suggests that sexual dimorphism likely existed at least in some species, such as Allosaurus fragilis.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Reconstructing the evolutionary history of different groups of organisms provides insight into how life originated and diversified on Earth. Phylogenetic trees are commonly used to estimate this evolutionary history, providing a hypothesis of the events. Within Bayesian phylogenetics a major step in estimating a tree is in choosing an appropriate model of character evolution. In the case of most extinct species, our only source of information to decipher their phylogenetic relationships is through the morphology of fossils. We therefore use a model of morphological character evolution, the most common of which being the Mk Lewis model. While it is frequently used in palaeobiology, it is not known whether the simple Mk substitution model, or any extensions to it, provide a sufficiently good description of the process of morphological evolution. To determine whether or not the Mk model is appropriate for fossil data we used posterior predictive simulations, a model adequacy approach, to estimate absolute fit of the model to morphological data sets. We first investigate the impact that different versions of the Mk model have on key parameter estimates using tetrapod data sets. We show that choice of substitution model has an impact on both topology and branch lengths, highlighting the importance of model choice. Next, we use simulations to investigate the power of posterior predictive simulations for morphology. Having validated this approach we show that current variations of the Mk model are in fact performing adequately in capturing the evolutionary dynamics that generated our data. We do not find any preference for a particular model extension across multiple data sets, indicating that there is no ‘one size fits all’ when it comes to morphological data and that careful consideration should be given to choosing models of discrete character evolution. By using suitable models of character evolution, we can increase our confidence in our phylogenetic estimates, which should in turn allow us to gain more accurate insights into the evolutionary history of both extinct and extant taxa.},

  abstract = {Impacts of chronic overfishing are evident in population depletions worldwide, yet indirect ecosystem effects induced by predator removal from oceanic food webs remain unpredictable. As abundances of all 11 great sharks that consume other elasmobranchs (rays, skates, and small sharks) fell over the past 35 years, 12 of 14 of these prey species increased in coastal northwest Atlantic ecosystems. Effects of this community restructuring have cascaded downward from the cownose ray, whose enhanced predation on its bay scallop prey was sufficient to terminate a century-long scallop fishery. Analogous top-down effects may be a predictable consequence of eliminating entire functional groups of predators.},

We outline shortcomings in this analysis that involve bone compactness sampling and measurement, lifestyle categorization, the inclusion and exclusion of taxa in the dataset, and flawed statistical methods and inferences. These many shortcomings undermine the evidence used to conclude that two spinosaurid taxa were avid divers. Bone compactness indices remain a valuable tool for interpretation of lifestyle in extinct species when based on sound dataset composition, robust statistical analysis, and consilience with evidence from functional, biomechanical, or paleoenvironmental considerations.},

  abstract = {Previous growth-rate studies covering 14 dinosaur taxa, as represented by 31 data sets, are critically examined and reanalyzed by using improved statistical techniques. The examination reveals that some previously reported results cannot be replicated by using the methods originally reported; results from new methods are in many cases different, in both the quantitative rates and the qualitative nature of the growth, from results in the prior literature. Asymptotic growth curves, which have been hypothesized to be ubiquitous, are shown to provide best fits for only four of the 14 taxa. Possible reasons for non-asymptotic growth patterns are discussed; they include systematic errors in the age-estimation process and, more likely, a bias toward younger ages among the specimens analyzed. Analysis of the data sets finds that only three taxa include specimens that could be considered skeletally mature (i.e., having attained 90\% of maximum body size predicted by asymptotic curve fits), and eleven taxa are quite immature, with the largest specimen having attained less than 62\% of predicted asymptotic size. The three taxa that include skeletally mature specimens are included in the four taxa that are best fit by asymptotic curves. The totality of results presented here suggests that previous estimates of both maximum dinosaur growth rates and maximum dinosaur sizes have little statistical support. Suggestions for future research are presented.},

For over a century, ceratopsian dinosaurs have inspired a multitude of cranial functional studies as more discoveries continued to depict a larger picture of the enormous diversity of these animals. The iconic horns and bony frills in many ceratopsians portray a plethora of shapes, sizes, and arrangements across taxa, and their overall feeding apparatus show the development of unique specializations previously unseen in large herbivores. Here, I give a brief updated review of the many functional studies investigating different aspects of the ceratopsian head. The functional role of the horns and bony frills is explored, with an overview of studies investigating their potential for weaponization or defense in either intraspecific or anti-predatory combat, among other things. A review of studies pertaining to the ceratopsian feeding apparatus is also presented here, with analyses of studies exploring their beak and snout morphology, dentition and tooth wear, cranial musculature with associated skull anatomy, and feeding biomechanics.},

Eotyrannus is represented by a single individual that would have been c. 4.5 m long; it preserves the anterior part of the skull, a partial forelimb and pectoral girdle, various cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, rib fragments, part of the ilium, and hindlimb elements excluding the femur. Lack of fusion with regard to both neurocentral and sacral sutures indicates subadult status. Eotyrannus possesses thickened, fused, pneumatic nasals with deep lateral recesses, elongate, tridactyl forelimbs and a tyrannosaurid-like scapulocoracoid. The short preantorbital ramus of the maxilla and nasals that are approximately seven times longer than they are wide show that Eotyrannus was not longirostrine. A posterodorsally inclined ridge on the ilium’s lateral surface fails to reach the dorsal margin: a configuration seen elsewhere in Juratyrant. Eotyrannus is not arctometatarsalian. Autapomorphies include the presence of curving furrows on the dentary, a block-like humeral entepicondyle, and a distoproximally aligned channel close to the distolateral border of the tibia. Within Tyrannosauroidea, E. lengi is phylogenetically intermediate between Proceratosauridae and Yutyrannus and the clade that includes Xiongguanlong, Megaraptora, Dryptosaurus and Tyrannosauridae. We do not find support for a close affinity between Eotyrannus and Juratyrant. Our analysis supports the inclusion of Megaraptora within Tyrannosauroidea and thus increases Cretaceous tyrannosauroid diversity and disparity. A proposal that Eotyrannus might belong within Megaraptora, however, is based on character states not present in the taxon. Several theropods from the Wessex Formation are based on material that overlaps with the E. lengi holotype but none can be shown to be synonymous with it.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner’s instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

  abstract = {Quantitative studies of fossil data have proven critical to a number of major macroevolutionary and macroecological discoveries, such as the ‘Big 5’ mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. The development and easy accessibility of major meta-data sources such as the Paleobiology Database and Geobiodiversity Database have also spurred the widespread application of these data to testing ecological hypotheses at finer spatiotemporal and phylogenetic scales. However, preservational, sampling, and taxonomic issues, along with analytical decisions, can impact the degree of interpretative resolution and obscure biological ‘signal’ from error/bias-introduced ‘noise’. The degree to which these factors can impact analytical interpretations is not well-documented in comparison to the scale of their application. Here, we review many forms of systematic bias that can creep into a paleoecological study, from the stage of data collection to the interpretation of analytical results. We provide two case studies where we artificially introduce such biases to previously-published datasets to illustrate their varying impacts on otherwise well-constrained data. The first case study focuses on the Cambrian Burgess Shale (konservat lagerstätte), and the second on bonebeds of the Cretaceous Belly River Group (konzentrat laggerstätte), with both representing highly-sampled, taphonomically-characterized, and spatiotemporally-constrained datasets developed through multiple years of sustained field collecting. In the former, we illustrate the impacts of collecting bias through quantitative comparisons of collected vs. discarded specimens over multiple field seasons and the impact of the loss of these data on ecological reconstructions and analysis. In the latter case study, we review the impact of preservational biases, differing approaches to their mitigation, and the impact of analytical decisions on ecological resolution. Lastly, we synthesize these case studies with our review of past approaches to propose a series of recommendations for future paleoecological and macroecological studies, emphasizing the continued importance of high-quality primary data and ongoing need for a first-principles approach to address existing issues of missing data.},

Although empirical studies of mass extinctions recognize that random sampling causes LOs to occur earlier than the time of extinction (Signor–Lipps effect), sequence stratigraphic controls on the position of LOs are rarely considered. By tracing stratigraphic ranges of extant mollusc species preserved in the Holocene succession of the Po coastal plain (Italy), we demonstrated that, if mass extinction took place today, complex but entirely false extinction patterns would be recorded regionally due to shifts in local community composition and non-random variation in the abundance of skeletal remains, both controlled by relative sea-level changes. Consequently, rather than following an apparent gradual pattern expected from the Signor–Lipps effect, LOs concentrated within intervals of stratigraphic condensation and strong facies shifts mimicking sudden extinction pulses. Methods assuming uniform recovery potential of fossils falsely supported stepwise extinction patterns among studied species and systematically underestimated their stratigraphic ranges. Such effects of stratigraphic architecture, co-produced by ecological, sedimentary and taphonomic processes, can easily confound interpretations of the timing, duration and selectivity of mass extinction events. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic context when inferring extinction dynamics from the fossil record.},

The frequency distributions of deviations between the theoretical (model) trajec tories and empirical datasets were tested for symmetry (with respect to the Y axis; the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Lehmann–Rosenblatt tests) and the presence or absence of serial correlation (the Swed–Eisenhart and “jumps up–jumps down” tests). The numerical calculations show that the set of points of the space of model parameters, when the deviations satisfy the statistical criteria, is not empty and, consequently, the model is suitable for describing empirical data.},

  abstract = {The ‘positive allometry hypothesis’ predicts that ornaments and weapons of sexual selection will scale steeply when among-individual variation in trait size is compared with variation in overall body size. Intuitive and striking, this idea has been explored in hundreds of contemporary animal species and sparked controversy in palaeobiology over the function of exaggerated structures in dinosaurs and other extinct lineages. Recently, however, challenges to this idea have raised questions regarding the validity of the hypothesis. We address this controversy in two ways. First, we suggest the positive allometry hypothesis be applied only to morphological traits that function as visual signals of individual body size. Second, because steep scaling slopes make traits better signals than other body parts, we propose that tests of the positive allometry hypothesis compare the steepness of the scaling relationships of focal, putative signal traits to those of other body parts in the same organism (rather than to an arbitrary slope of 1). We provide data for a suite of 29 extreme structures and show that steep scaling relationships are common when structures function as signals of relative body size, but not for comparably extreme structures that function in other contexts. We discuss these results in the context of animal signalling and sexual selection, and conclude that patterns of static scaling offer powerful insight into the evolution and function of disproportionately large, or extreme, animal structures. Finally, using data from a ceratopsid dinosaur and a pterosaur, we show that our revised test can be applied to fossil assemblages, making this an exciting and powerful method for gleaning insight into the function of structures in extinct taxa.},

  abstract = {The distribution of species body size is critically important for determining resource use within a group or clade. It is widely known that non-avian dinosaurs were the largest creatures to roam the Earth. There is, however, little understanding of how maximum species body size was distributed among the dinosaurs. Do they share a similar distribution to modern day vertebrate groups in spite of their large size, or did they exhibit fundamentally different distributions due to unique evolutionary pressures and adaptations? Here, we address this question by comparing the distribution of maximum species body size for dinosaurs to an extensive set of extant and extinct vertebrate groups. We also examine the body size distribution of dinosaurs by various sub-groups, time periods and formations. We find that dinosaurs exhibit a strong skew towards larger species, in direct contrast to modern day vertebrates. This pattern is not solely an artefact of bias in the fossil record, as demonstrated by contrasting distributions in two major extinct groups and supports the hypothesis that dinosaurs exhibited a fundamentally different life history strategy to other terrestrial vertebrates. A disparity in the size distribution of the herbivorous Ornithischia and Sauropodomorpha and the largely carnivorous Theropoda suggests that this pattern may have been a product of a divergence in evolutionary strategies: herbivorous dinosaurs rapidly evolved large size to escape predation by carnivores and maximise digestive efficiency; carnivores had sufficient resources among juvenile dinosaurs and non-dinosaurian prey to achieve optimal success at smaller body size.},

  abstract = {Variation in the extent of sexual dimorphism among bird species is traditionally attributed to differences in social mating system. However, there are many different forms of dimorphism among birds, and not all of them show an obvious correlation with social mating system. For example, recent work has shown that many highly polygamous species are, in fact, monomorphic, whereas many putatively monogamous species are dimorphic. In this paper we break up sexual dimorphism into subcomponents and then use comparative analyses to examine the pattern of covariation between these subcomponents and various aspects of sexual, social, and parental behaviour. Our first finding is that size dimorphism and plumage–colour dimorphism do not show the same pattern of covariation. Differences in size dimorphism are associated with variation in social mating system and sex differences in parental care, whereas differences in plumage–colour dimorphism are associated with variation in the frequency of extra–bond paternity. These results suggest that size dimorphism is associated with the sort of intrasexual competition described by traditional classifications of social mating system, whereas plumage–colour dimorphism is associated with cryptic female choice. However, when we break up plumage–colour dimorphism according to whether it is due to melanins, carotenoids or structural colours, we find that each category of plumage–colour dimorphism shows a different pattern of covariation. The correlation between overall plumage–colour dimorphism and the rate of extra–bond paternity is due to structural colours, whereas melanin–based dimorphism is associated with sex differences in parental care. The former result is particularly interesting given that new work suggests structural colours are associated with active sexual displays and the reflection of ultraviolet light.},

Currently, most phylogenies of extant taxa are inferred from molecules and when morphological and molecular trees conflict the latter are often preferred. Although supported by simulations, the superiority of molecular trees has rarely been assessed empirically. Here we test phylogenetic accuracy using two independent data sources: biogeographic distributions and fossil first occurrences. For 48 pairs of morphological and molecular trees we show that, on average, molecular trees provide a better fit to biogeographic data than their morphological counterparts and that biogeographic congruence increases over research time. We find no significant differences in stratigraphic congruence between morphological and molecular trees. These results have implications for understanding the distribution of homoplasy in morphological data sets, the utility of morphology as a test of molecular hypotheses and the implications of analysing fossil groups for which molecular data are unavailable.},

  abstract = {‘Bizarre structures’ in dinosaurs have four main traditional explanations: mechanical function, sexual selection, social selection and species recognition. Any of these can be plausible for individual species, but they fail to be persuasive when other lines of evidence cannot adequately test them. The first three also fail as general propositions when phylogenetic analyses based on other characters do not support scenarios of selective improvement of such functions in their clade (or the explanation simply does not apply to any other species in the clade). Moreover, the hypothesis of sexual selection requires significant sexual dimorphism, which has never been conclusively established in dinosaurs. We propose instead that species recognition may have been a more general force that drove the evolution of bizarre structures in dinosaurs. That is, the bizarre structures communicate to other individuals a variety of possible associational cues, including species identification, potential protection and social habits and the appropriateness of potential mates. In other words, bizarre structures amount to an advertisement for positive association. Neither species recognition nor any other hypothesis should be a ‘default’ explanation. Although direct observation is impossible, we propose two tests. First, contrary to adaptive, social or sexual selection, under the species recognition model morphology should be expected to evolve without obvious directional trends, because the only objective is to differ from one's relatives. Hence, patterns of evolution of bizarre structures should be relatively proliferative and non-directional. Second, several contemporaneous species should overlap in geographic range (sympatric, parapatric, peripatric). Fossil species often show evidence of this pattern in the past by ‘ghost ranges’ of related taxa. These tests together could reinforce or weaken an argument for species recognition.},

  abstract = {Living crocodylians are frequently regarded as morphologically and ecologically conservative, contrasting with the group's rich fossil record, which reveals a much higher diversity. In particular, Caimaninae is a striking example of such diversity, with only six extant species but a myriad of extinct taxa, exhibiting remarkable morphological variation. Their skulls vary substantially, with robust and flattened shapes, ranging from short to long snouts, and serve as a basis for many evolutionary studies in the group. Previous works have demonstrated that the skull is a good proxy to estimate the body size of extinct crocodylians. In this study, we estimate the body size of large Caimaninae specimens from the Miocene of South America, including Purussaurus and Mourasuchus. For that, we elaborated a comprehensive dataset of body size data collected from living crocodylians to generate regression equations. We performed regression analyses both including and excluding juvenile/subadult specimens, to account for the possible influence of ontogeny on the relationship between cranial measurements and body size. Furthermore, we also employed two different approaches (phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic) for estimating the body size of these Miocene caimanines. Our results indicate a significant influence of ontogeny on the body proportions of crocodylians, suggesting that datasets used for estimating the body size of extinct taxa should not include juvenile specimens. Moreover, the phylogenetic approach provided more conservative estimates, possibly as a result of the phylogenetic position of the analyzed taxa, given that the body size metrics are strongly phylogenetically structured in crocodylians. This is the first study to infer the body size of fossil caimanines using different methods and skeletal measurements, as well as a dataset comprised of solely adult crocodylians. In the light of our results, we also discuss the paleobiological implications of the large size of these Miocene caimanines.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Numerous non-avian dinosaurs possessed pennaceous feathers on their forelimbs (proto-wings) and tail (caudal plumage). Their functions remain unclear. We propose that the pennaceous feathers were used in displays to flush prey through stimulation of sensory-neural escape pathways in prey, and to provide higher speed and maneuverability during pursuits after prey. We evaluated escape behavior of grasshoppers to the hypothetical visual flush-displays by a robotic dinosaur, and neurophysiological responses of grasshoppers’ escape pathway to computer animations of the hypothetical flush-displays by dinosaurs. We confirmed that prey of small dinosaurs might have escaped more often when proto-wings were present, especially distally and with contrasting patterns, and when caudal plumage, especially of large area, was used during the hypothetical flush-displays. The reinforcing loop between flush and pursue functions could have contributed to the evolution of larger and stiffer feathers for faster running, maneuverability, and stronger flush-displays, promoting foraging based on the flush-pursue strategy. The flush-pursue hypothesis can explain the presence and distribution of the pennaceous feathers, plumage color contrasts, as well as a number of other features observed in early pennaraptorans. This scenario highlights that sensory-neural processes underlying prey’s antipredatory reactions may contribute to the origin of major evolutionary innovations in predators.},

To that end, we designed a literature-guided developer survey that we deployed on social media, receiving 170 total responses. We also searched on StackOverflow and analyzed 38 threads relevant to flaky tests, offering a distinct perspective free of any self-reporting bias. Using a mixture of numerical and thematic analyses, this study revealed a number of findings, including (1) developers strongly agree that flaky tests hinder continuous integration; (2) developers who experience flaky tests more often may be more likely to ignore potentially genuine test failures; and (3) developers rate issues in setup and teardown to be the most common causes of flaky tests.},

Archaeologists usually consider the Old Women‘s Phase to represent ancestral Nitsitapii (Blackfoot). The Nitsitapii word for fossilized ammonites is ‘Iniskim‘ or Buffalo Stones. Nitsitapii oral tradition records an ancient origin for the use of Iniskim. Originally, lniskim were used as part of a pre-hunt ritual that produced the power to insure a successful hunt by charming bison. The power associated with Iniskim resulted in their customary inclusion in Nitsitapii personal, healing, sacred tipi, and ceremonial bundles. Although there are examples of other First Nations possessing similar objects, none exhibit as strong a tradition surrounding these items as the Nitsitapii. The repeated association of ammonites with the archaeological material of the Old Women‘s Phase in contexts suggesting bison charming and ceremonial significance, coupled with the evidence for the antiquity and pervasive traditional use of these fossils as Iniskim among the Nitsitapii, is argued to support the Nitsitapii (Blackfoot) - Old Women‘s Phase correlation.},

  abstract = {Here we describe an extremely large and relatively complete (roughly 65\%) skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex (RSM P2523.8). Multiple measurements (including those of the skull, hip, and limbs) show that RSM P2523.8 was a robust individual with an estimated body mass exceeding all other known T. rex specimens and representatives of all other gigantic terrestrial theropods. Histological sampling of the fibula confirms that RSM P2523.8 is skeletally mature. The prevalence of incompletely coossified elements contradicts previous assertions that such unfused elements can be taken as indicators of somatic immaturity. As an extreme example of both ontogenetic maturity and osteological robustness, RSM P2523.8 offers support for prior hypotheses that a sampling bias occurs throughout the Dinosauria, making it likely that most taxa grew to significantly greater size than current known specimens indicate.

  abstract = {The life history of Confuciusornis sanctus is controversial. Recently, the species’ body size spectrum was claimed to contradict osteohistological evidence for a rapid, bird-like development. Moreover, sexual size dimorphism was rejected as an explanation for the observed bimodal size distribution since the presence of elongated rectrices, an assumed ‘male’ trait, was uncorrelated with size. However, this interpretation (i) fails to explain the size spectrum of C. sanctus which is trimodal rather than bimodal, (ii) requires implausible neonate masses and (iii) is not supported by analogy with sexual dimorphisms in modern birds, in which elongated central rectrices are mostly sex-independent. Available information on C. sanctus is readily reconciled if we assume a bird-like life history, as well as a pronounced sexual size dimorphism and sexually isomorphic extravagant feathers as frequently observed in extant species.},

  abstract = {Carcharocles megalodon (“Megalodon”) is the largest shark that ever lived. Based on its distribution, dental morphology, and associated fauna, it has been suggested that this species was a cosmopolitan apex predator that fed on marine mammals from the middle Miocene to the Pliocene (15.9–2.6 Ma). Prevailing theory suggests that the extinction of apex predators affects ecosystem dynamics. Accordingly, knowing the time of extinction of C. megalodon is a fundamental step towards understanding the effects of such an event in ancient communities. However, the time of extinction of this important species has never been quantitatively assessed. Here, we synthesize the most recent records of C. megalodon from the literature and scientific collections and infer the date of its extinction by making a novel use of the Optimal Linear Estimation (OLE) model. Our results suggest that C. megalodon went extinct around 2.6 Ma. Furthermore, when contrasting our results with known ecological and macroevolutionary trends in marine mammals, it became evident that the modern composition and function of modern gigantic filter-feeding whales was established after the extinction of C. megalodon. Consequently, the study of the time of extinction of C. megalodon provides the basis to improve our understanding of the responses of marine species to the removal of apex predators, presenting a deep-time perspective for the conservation of modern ecosystems.},

The Angeac-Charente Lagerstätte (France) represents a remarkable ‘snapshot’ from a Berriasian (Early Cretaceous) ecosystem and offers a unique opportunity to study intraspecific variation among a herd of at least 61 coeval ornithomimosaurs. Herein, we investigated the hindlimb variation across the best-preserved specimens from the herd through 3D Geometric Morphometrics and Gaussian Mixture Modeling. Our results based on complete and fragmented femora evidenced a dimorphism characterized by variations in the shaft curvature and the distal epiphysis width. Since the same features vary between sexes among modern avian dinosaurs, crocodilians, and more distant amniotes, we attributed this bimodal variation to sexual dimorphism based on the extant phylogenetic bracketing approach. Documenting sexual dimorphism in fossil dinosaurs allows a better characterization and accounting of intraspecific variations, which is particularly relevant to address ongoing taxonomical and ecological questions relative to dinosaur evolution.},

Strong positive allometric relationships were found between measures of body length and other morphometric attributes, and provide a reliable means to estimate body length from tracks, skulls, and body parts. The maximum DCL:CW ratio is attained at a relatively small body size and preceded a dietary shift from insects and arachnids to vertebrates and ampullarid snails. The SL:SW ratio of C. moreletii is highly variable and because of overlap with C. acutus, deemed of little value for distinguishing these two sympatric species. Both overall and adult sex ratio (female:male) was male biased and differed significantly from parity. The mean SVL of adult males (98.3 ± 21.3 cm) was significantly greater than that of adult females (87.3 ± 15.9 cm). A compressed sexual size dimorphism index (SDI) of 2.12 was calculated for C. moreletii in northern Belize. Based on skull measurements, the current size record for C. moreletii in Belize is 362 cm TL. Standing crop biomass of C. moreletii at our principal study site (Gold Button Lagoon) was estimated to be 9.5 kg/ha.},

Vertebrate trace fossils such as footprints and trackways, however, have been markedly underrepresented. Trackways can provide a wealth of information regarding behaviour and soft tissues reflective of autopodial anatomy. Discovery of several giant, high-fidelity ichnites in series from the Morrin Member represents the first definitive dinosaur trackway reported from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. The trackway is composed of three footprint casts in series, alongside 22 associated ichnites. The ichnites were formed in soft sediment molds along a non-uniform walking surface. The deep substrates allowed for the preservation of both the plantar surface and dorsal components of the trackmakers’ feet. Some ichnites show soft tissue morphologies like interdigital webbing, toe pads, and skin impressions. Presence of these features and small kidney-shaped forelimb prints allow referral to Hadrosauropodus langstoni. The preservation of the trackway demonstrates asymmetries useful for comparison of the relief and impression surfaces of prints using both discrete and morphometric characteristics, improving confidence in identifying partial or isolated Hadrosauropodus prints of various modes of formation.},

Subglottis and trachea are dynamic structures and the internal dimensions and contours have been studied only on cadavers or by plain radiograph which has many technical and measurement errors. No data is available about the internal dimensions of the subglottic and trachea in Indian population. This is the first documented study to measure the dimensions of the trachea and subglottis in Indian population. The aim of this study is to measure the internal dimensions and contour of the subglottis and upper trachea of adult Indian population. We conducted cross-sectional, observational study in a university hospital in south India to measure the dimensions of the internal subglottic and upper tracheal lumen. CT scan with 3D reconstruction with multiplanar sections was used for precise measurements. Forty-eight subjects (30 male and 18 female) who had undergone CT scan of the neck and thorax for reasons other than airway compromise were included in the study. The internal coronal diameter (CD), sagittal diameter (SD), and circumference was measured at various levels from  5 to 70~mm below the level of glottis, in the subglottis and upper trachea. Measurements of the scan for each subject were done independently by a radiologist and ENT surgeon and average of the two were documented values of each subject. These measurements were then statistically analyzed using SSPS software. The mean CD of adult Indian male ranged from 13.18 to 17.68~mm. The average intraluminal circumference ranged from 48.82~mm at the subglottis 5~mm from the glottis to a maximum of 54.96 at 30~mm. The mean CD of adult Indian female ranged from 8.7 to 15.34~mm The average intraluminal circumference ranged from 36.5 at 5~mm and a maximum of 43.05 at 70~mm. The 95\% CI for the coronal, sagittal and circumference of the subglottis and upper trachea for both genders have been calculated and discussed. We have observed that the average intraluminal dimensions of the subglottis and upper trachea in south Indian population is less than that reported in western literature and earlier studies.},

The confidence interval for the estimated expected value of the face value will be around 3.5 and will become narrower with a larger sample size. However, the prediction interval for the next roll will approximately range from 1 to 6, even with any number of samples seen so far. Prediction intervals are used in both frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics: a prediction interval bears the same relationship to a future observation that a frequentist confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval bears to an unobservable population parameter: prediction intervals predict the distribution of individual future points, whereas confidence intervals and credible intervals of parameters predict the distribution of estimates of the true population mean or other quantity of interest that cannot be observed.},

While most fossil turtles (Thalassochelydia) were found in marly layers that were deposited in a coastal marine paleoenvironment, the dinosaur (theropod and sauropod) tracks were found in laminites that were deposited in a tidal flat environment. Despite extensive exploration, very few body fossils were found in these dinosaur track-bearing laminites. On one occasion, a sub-complete turtle shell (Plesiochelys bigleri) was discovered within the laminites, embedded just beneath an important sauropod track level. The state of preservation of this specimen suggests that the turtle died on the tidal flat and was quickly buried. This is the first evidence that these turtles occasionally visited tidal flat paleoenvironments. Moreover, the particular configuration of the fossil turtle suggests that the shell was possibly trodden on by a large sauropod dinosaur.},

We used network modeling of macroinvertebrate WIS and GCP fauna to test whether biotic provinces existed and to examine their relationships with abiotic change. Results suggest a cohesive WIS unit existed across the Campanian, and distinct WIS and GCP provinces existed in the Maastrichtian. Sea-level changes coincided with changes in network metrics.

The focus is on three topics: extinction rates and severities, phylogenetic nonrandomness of extinction, and the testing of hypotheses relating extinction-proneness to attributes of organisms or species. Phylogenetic and taxic approaches to extinction have not fully fused, largely because of the difficulties of relating discrete taxa to the underlying continuity of phylogeny.

Eight pedotypes representing hydromorphic, moderately-drained and well-drained paleosols were recognized. When considered within their stratigraphic context, these paleosols show that palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes occurred either gradually between major lithological subdivisions of the HCFm or relatively rapidly within subdivisions. Hydromorphic paleosols, predominant in the coal-bearing stratigraphic interval at the base of the HCFm, were gradually replaced by well-drained paleosols in the overlying coal-poor interval. While climate remained warm and humid during this change in soil drainage conditions, mean annual temperature and precipitation dropped rapidly higher in section, shortly prior to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, without concomitant lithological or pedological changes. A brief return of poorly-drained paleosols in the middle of the HCFm coincides with a regional marine transgression (Drumheller Marine Tongue). Well-drained palaeoenvironments, associated with a warm and dry climate, persisted through the upper part of the HCFm until a gradual return to poorly-drained conditions and to a warm, humid climate occurred at the top of the formation. An important decline in turtle diversity through the HCFm, previously attributed to climate, is shown to coincide instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, where aridity, landscape instability, and migratory barriers possibly acted as secondary limiting factors to faunal recovery.},

  abstract = {The fascination with ancient flora and fauna is a centuries-old phenomenon and is one of the main drivers of fossil crimes. Fossils have been sought by the rich and famous since the advent of colonialism, propelling development in the field of palaeontology but also in how fossils make their way through various, sometimes illegal, corridors to end up in museums and collections across the world. As demand for fossils increased in the nineteenth century, so did commercial avenues for these objects that were being sold not only to private individuals but also to scientific institutions. The most complete and visually impressive fossils in terms of size or uniqueness determine the market value of these fossils with some selling for millions of United States dollars. This has also led to the tampering or forging of fossils by many dealers in an attempt to inflate prices. While fossil crimes have been prevalent for centuries, the legal frameworks within which these crimes can be controlled or stopped are regularly challenged or even circumvented not only due to the lack of enforcements of these regulations but also due to how paleontological objects are classified in the first place as well as other legal loopholes.},

  abstract = {A new method is presented for inferring evolutionary trees using nucleotide sequence data. The birth-death process is used as a model of speciation and extinction to specify the prior distribution of phylogenies and branching times. Nucleotide substitution is modeled by a continuous-time Markov process. Parameters of the branching model and the substitution model are estimated by maximum likelihood. The posterior probabilities of different phylogenies are calculated and the phylogeny with the highest posterior probability is chosen as the best estimate of the evolutionary relationship among species. We refer to this as the maximum posterior probability (MAP) tree. The posterior probability provides a natural measure of the reliability of the estimated phylogeny. Two example data sets are analyzed to infer the phylogenetic relationship of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. The best trees estimated by the new method are the same as those from the maximum likelihood analysis of separate topologies, but the posterior probabilities are quite different from the bootstrap proportions. The results of the method are found to be insensitive to changes in the rate parameter of the branching process.},

We quantify the effects of restoring wolf populations by evaluating their influence on deer–vehicle collisions (DVCs) in Wisconsin. We show that, for the average county, wolf entry reduced DVCs by 24\%, yielding an economic benefit that is 63 times greater than the costs of verified wolf predation on livestock. Most of the reduction is due to a behavioral response of deer to wolves rather than through a deer population decline from wolf predation. This finding supports ecological research emphasizing the role of predators in creating a “landscape of fear.” It suggests wolves control economic damages from overabundant deer in ways that human deer hunters cannot.},

  abstract = {Ecology and morphology are different, and yet in comparative studies of fossil vertebrates the two are often conflated. The macroevolution of Mesozoic marine tetrapods has been explored in terms of morphological disparity, but less commonly using ecological-functional categories. Here we use ecospace modelling to quantify ecological disparity across all Mesozoic marine tetrapods. We document the explosive radiation of marine tetrapod groups in the Triassic and their rapid attainment of high ecological disparity. Late Triassic extinctions led to a marked decline in ecological disparity, and the recovery of ecospace and ecological disparity was sluggish in the Early Jurassic. High levels of ecological disparity were again achieved by the Late Jurassic and maintained during the Cretaceous, when the ecospace became saturated by the Late Cretaceous. Sauropterygians, turtles and ichthyosauromorphs were the largest contributors to ecological disparity. Throughout the Mesozoic, we find that established groups remained ecologically conservative and did not explore occupied or vacant niches. Several parts of the ecospace remained vacant for long spans of time. Newly evolved, radiating taxa almost exclusively explored unoccupied ecospace, suggesting that abiotic releases are needed to empty niches and initiate diversification. In the balance of evolutionary drivers in Mesozoic marine tetrapods, abiotic factors were key to initiating diversification events, but biotic factors dominated the subsequent generation of ecological diversity.},

Here, we make extensive expansions to an earlier multispecies occupancy model used to estimate the dynamics of relative species abundance in fossil communities. These expansions include incorporating counts of individuals at sites, explicitly allowing for the inclusion of specimens assignable to genus – but not species-level, a situation common in paleontology, and modelling regional presence/absence. We provide simulations to check the performance of this new model, as well as simulations to quantify the benefits of using individual count data versus subsample occupancy data, and model estimates versus face-value (raw) estimates, respectively. We also provide an empirical case study using occupancy data from a community of marine benthic colonial animals preserved in the Pleistocene of New Zealand. We find that the new model performs well, especially when it comes to recovering relative abundance dynamics and that it is well worth the effort to both collect individual count data and to include individuals unidentified to species-level in the site-occupancy modelling framework. This extended model can be widely applied in paleoecological settings and is necessary when both the average and uncertainty values of relative abundance dynamics need to be robustly estimated.},

We demonstrate our modeling framework using a fossil community of benthic organisms to estimate relative species abundance dynamics and changing relative population densities of focal species in nine (geological) time intervals over 2.3 Myr. We also explore potential explanatory factors (paleoenvironmental proxies) and temporal autocorrelation that could provide extra information on unsampled time intervals.

  abstract = {Sexual dimorphism describes phenotypic differences between the sexes; the most prominent of which is sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Rensch's Rule (RR) is an allometric trend in which SSD increases in male-larger taxa and decreases in female-larger ones. Covariation between a trait and overall size within and across species can both be affected by sexual and natural selection. Thus, intraspecific allometric variation could influence the expression of RR. Here we used computer simulations to dissect how RR emerges under specific allometric patterns of intraspecific sexual differentiation in a trait. We found that sexual differentiation in static allometric slopes is the main determinant of RR. Based on our findings, RR and its converse can manifest in both body size and other traits. As a realistic showcase, we also examined RR and static allometry of different body parts in Mediterranean green lizards to establish whether intraspecific and evolutionary allometry are linked. Here, we identified RR and its converse for different traits, where the amount of sexual differentiation in static allometric slopes within species had a significant contribution to RR. Integrating the simulations and the empirical case we corroborate that sexual differentiation in static allometric slopes is a major parameter affecting evolutionary allometry.},

In order to gain counts of species from samples, analyze chemical compositions, or extract morphological properties of foraminifera, research labs require human time and effort handling and sorting these microscopic fossils. The presented work describes Forabot, an open-source system which can physically manipulate individual foraminifera for imaging and isolation with minimal human interaction. The major components to build a Forabot are outlined in this work, with supplementary information available which allows for other researchers to build a Forabot with low-cost, off-the-shelf components. From a washed and sieved sample of hundreds of foraminifera, the Forabot is shown to be capable of isolating and imaging individual forams. The timing of the Forabot's current pipeline allows for the processing of up to 27 foram specimens per hour, a rate that can be improved for future classification purposes by reducing image quality and/or quantity. Along with the physical descriptions, the image processing and classification pipelines are also reviewed. A proof-of-concept classifier utilizes a finetuned VGG-16 network to achieve a classification accuracy of 79\% on a validation set of foraminifera images collected with Forabot. In conclusion, the system is able to be built by researchers for a low cost, effectively manipulate foraminifera with few mistakes, provide quality images for future research, and classify the species of imaged forams.},

These processes are influenced by the size and geographical complexity of regions, conditions of the environment, and attributes of individuals and species. Diversity within clades also depends on age and thus the time available for accumulating species. Estimating rates of diversification is key to understanding how these factors have shaped patterns of species richness. Several approaches to calculating both relative and absolute rates of speciation and extinction within clades are based on phylogenetic reconstructions of evolutionary relationships. As the size and quality of phylogenies increases, these approaches will find broader application. However, phylogeny reconstruction fosters a perceptual bias of continual increase in species richness, and the analysis of primarily large clades produces a data selection bias. Recognizing these biases will encourage the development of more realistic models of diversification and the regulation of species richness.},

When applied to morphometric data, this analytical tool can yield palaeoecological, ontogenetic and demographic information. We have adapted and expanded a statistical tool used in reliability engineering, mechanical or electrical lifetime analysis, geochemistry and ore mineral analysis to analyse fossil populations. The technique is explained stepwise in a ‘user's manual’ format. Its power is to characterize statistical distribution types, to determine whether these distributions are skewed or truncated, and to resolve and quantify the components of mixed distributions, which in palaeontological data potentially represent morphological groupings such as cohorts or sexual dimorphs. The ease of application and simplicity are surprising. A probability plot of growth series data (e.g. skull lengths, femoral lengths, snout-to-vent lengths or other morphometrics) typically shows complex non-normal distribution of the data because of multimodal composition. We show that these component modes, which are generally, but not always normal (i.e. Gaussian), can be resolved, and that they correspond to yearly age groups (cohorts), sexual dimorphs, pre- and post-metamorphic forms, other ontogenetic stages or possibly mixed taxa. When these component size distributions are associated with an age group or sex, several important palaeoecological calculations become possible. These include growth curves, age and sex distributions, sexual dimorphism indices, etc. We demonstrate the biological and palaeontological utility of probability plots with several examples including a Permian wingless insect, an extant unionid bivalve, a Triassic metoposaurid amphibian, an extant lizard, and a Triassic theropod dinosaur.},

Here we use simulations to evaluate the performance of seven methods proposed to estimate the upper confidence limit on extinction times under different extinction and sampling scenarios. Our results show that the ability of existing methods to correctly estimate the timing of extinctions varies with the type of extinction (sudden vs. gradual) and the nature of sampling effort over time. When the probability of sampling a species declines over time, many of the methods perform poorly. On the other hand, the simulation results also suggest that as long as the choice of the method is determined by the nature of the underlying sighting data, existing methods should provide reliable inferences about the timing of past extinctions.},

By this time, the dodo had become extremely rare — the previous sighting having been 24 years earlier — but the species probably persisted unseen beyond this date. Here we use a statistical method to establish the actual extinction time of the dodo as 1690, almost 30 years after its most recent sighting.Figure 1Dead as a dodo: the flightless bird from Mauritius and the adjacent islands weighed in at about 23 kg and was hunted to extinction.Its last confirmed sighting was in 1662, although an escaped slave claimed to have seen the bird as recently as 1674. In fact, it is estimated by using a Weibull distribution method that the dodo may have persisted until 1690, almost 30 years after its presumed extinction date. Although gone forever, the dodo's lumbering appearance in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has ensured that it will not be forgotten.},

Tooth marks of theropods, although rarely described and generally left unassigned to a particular taxon, can provide unique clues into predator–prey interaction8, and can also yield insights into the extent of carcass utilization9,10. Here we describe a sample of tooth-marked dinosaur bone recovered from three well-documented localities in the Upper Cretaceous Maevarano Formation of Madagascar that provides insights into the feeding ecology of the abelisaurid theropod Majungatholus atopus11. Intensely tooth-marked elements from multiple individuals show that Majungatholus defleshed dinosaur carcasses. Furthermore, Majungatholus clearly fed upon the remains of not only sauropods, but also conspecifics, and thus was a cannibal. Cannibalism is a common ecological strategy among extant carnivores, but until now the evidence in relation to carnivorous dinosaurs has been sparse and anecdotal.},

Correlation of the Judith River Formation in Montana with the Foremost, Oldman, and Dinosaur Park Formations (= Belly River Group) in Canada has been challenging for a variety of reasons, including lithostratigraphic complexities, legacy bentonite ages of limited comparability, and distinctly different stratigraphic models on opposite sides of the international border. An updated model calibrated with U-Pb zircon ages provides an improved framework for stratigraphic analysis. New geochronology indicates that the Oldman−Dinosaur Park discontinuity in Dinosaur Provincial Park correlates in age with the mid-Judith discontinuity in the Judith River Formation in Montana, which is interpreted as an expansion surface linked to a major pulse of accommodation and onset of the Bearpaw transgression at ca. 76.3 Ma. The regionally expressed shift in alluvial facies marking the mid-Judith discontinuity can be traced in well logs from Montana to southern Canada, where it loses distinction and transitions to a subsurface signature typical of the Oldman−Dinosaur Park discontinuity, which in turn can be traced north to Dinosaur Provincial Park and beyond. Across this expanse, both discontinuities parallel the Eagle/Milk River shoulder at approximately the same stratigraphic height, confirming their chronostratigraphic significance. These findings have clear implications for regional correlation and the evolution of alluvial depositional systems in a foreland basin setting, and they afford an opportunity to evaluate existing interpretations and advance understanding of the stratigraphy and paleontology of the Judith River−Belly River wedge. The term “Judith River−Belly River discontinuity” should be used henceforth to refer to the chronostratigraphically significant stratal discontinuity that subdivides the Judith River−Belly River wedge throughout the plains of north-central Montana, southern Alberta, and southwestern Saskatchewan.},

  abstract = {Despite reports of sexual dimorphism in extinct taxa, such claims in non-avian dinosaurs have been rare over the last decade and have often been criticized. Since dimorphism is widespread in sexually reproducing organisms today, under-reporting in the literature might suggest either methodological shortcomings or that this diverse group exhibited highly unusual reproductive biology. Univariate significance testing, especially for bimodality, is ineffective and prone to false negatives. Species recognition and mutual sexual selection hypotheses, therefore, may not be required to explain supposed absence of sexual dimorphism across the grade (a type II error). Instead, multiple lines of evidence support sexual selection and variation of structures consistent with secondary sexual characteristics, strongly suggesting sexual dimorphism in non-avian dinosaurs. We propose a framework for studying sexual dimorphism in fossils, focusing on likely secondary sexual traits and testing against all alternate hypotheses for variation in them using multiple lines of evidence. We use effect size statistics appropriate for low sample sizes, rather than significance testing, to analyse potential divergence of growth curves in traits and constrain estimates for dimorphism magnitude. In many cases, estimates of sexual variation can be reasonably accurate, and further developments in methods to improve sex assignments and account for intrasexual variation (e.g. mixture modelling) will improve accuracy. It is better to compare estimates for the magnitude of and support for dimorphism between datasets than to dichotomously reject or fail to reject monomorphism in a single species, enabling the study of sexual selection across phylogenies and time. We defend our approach with simulated and empirical data, including dinosaur data, showing that even simple approaches can yield fairly accurate estimates of sexual variation in many cases, allowing for comparison of species with high and low support for sexual variation.},

  abstract = {Conclusive evidence for sexual dimorphism in non-avian dinosaurs has been elusive. Here it is shown that dimorphism in the shape of the dermal plates of Stegosaurus mjosi (Upper Jurassic, western USA) does not result from non-sex-related individual, interspecific, or ontogenetic variation and is most likely a sexually dimorphic feature. One morph possessed wide, oval plates 45\% larger in surface area than the tall, narrow plates of the other morph. Intermediate morphologies are lacking as principal component analysis supports marked size- and shape-based dimorphism. In contrast, many non-sex-related individual variations are expected to show intermediate morphologies. Taphonomy of a new quarry in Montana (JRDI 5ES Quarry) shows that at least five individuals were buried in a single horizon and were not brought together by water or scavenger transportation. This new site demonstrates co-existence, and possibly suggests sociality, between two morphs that only show dimorphism in their plates. Without evidence for niche partitioning, it is unlikely that the two morphs represent different species. Histology of the new specimens in combination with studies on previous specimens indicates that both morphs occur in fully-grown individuals. Therefore, the dimorphism is not a result of ontogenetic change. Furthermore, the two morphs of plates do not simply come from different positions on the back of a single individual. Plates from all positions on the body can be classified as one of the two morphs, and previously discovered, isolated specimens possess only one morph of plates. Based on the seemingly display-oriented morphology of plates, female mate choice was likely the driving evolutionary mechanism rather than male-male competition. Dinosaur ornamentation possibly served similar functions to the ornamentation of modern species. Comparisons to ornamentation involved in sexual selection of extant species, such as the horns of bovids, may be appropriate in predicting the function of some dinosaur ornamentation.},

Here, we evaluate the methodology and conclusions made by the authors. Reanalysis of their dataset with additions and consistently applied methodologies, shows that there is no strong evidence for a single anagenetic lineage within ‘Tyrannosaurus-line’ tyrannosaurines throughout the latest Cretaceous. Our study demonstrates a cladogenetic Tyrannosaurinae composed of four morphologically and biogeographically distinct clades. Two of these clades are formally defined and diagnosed herein (Teratophoneini clade nov. and Tyrannosaurini). Teratophoneini is currently restricted to the southern latitudes of Campanian Laramidia, while Tyrannosaurini is present in both Campanian and Maastrichtian strata in Asia and Laramidia. Inclusion of a currently unnamed species of Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park and Oldman formations to the dataset reveals that anagenesis is not found to be a driver of speciation within Daspletosaurus. We also demonstrate that all known species of Daspletosaurus do not meet previously established prerequisites for anagenesis and advise against prematurity when making conclusions concerning significant processes surrounding the mode of evolution of extinct genera with sparse and often incomplete fossil records. Future detailed anatomical description of specimens representing the proposed fourth species of Daspletosaurus will further aid in elucidating the evolution of this genus and tyrannosaurines more generally.},

  abstract = {Archosauria originated around the Earth's largest biotic crisis that severely affected all ecosystems globally, the Permotriassic Mass extinction event, and comprises two crown-group lineages: the bird-lineage and the crocodylian lineage. The bird lineage includes the iconic pterosaurs, as well as dinosaurs and birds, whereas the crocodylian lineage includes clades such as aetosaurs, poposaurs, “rauisuchians,” as well as Crocodylomorpha; the latter being represented today only by less than 30 extant species of Crocodylia. Despite playing important roles during Mesozoic and Cenozoic ecosystems, both on land and in water, Pseudosuchia received far less attention compared to the birdlineage, which is also reflected in number and scope of histological studies so far. Lately, the field has seen a shift of focus toward pseudosuchians, however, and the symposium on “Paleohistological Inferences of Paleobiological Traits in Pseudosuchia” held during the International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology 2023 in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, is the latest proof of that. To put these novel aspects of paleohistological and paleobiological research into context, an overview of the non-extant pseudosuchian taxa whose postcranial bones were studied so far is provided here (c. 80 species out of a total of more than 700 extinct species described) and recent trends in pseudosuchian osteohistology are highlighted. In addition, histological studies on cranial and dental material and other potential hard tissues, such as eggshells and otoliths, are briefly reviewed as well.},

  abstract = {The Triassic–Jurassic transition, which is here broadly defined as extending from the Late Triassic through the Early Jurassic (\textasciitilde 237 Ma to 174 Ma), was an important interval in Earth history. The end-Triassic mass extinction (ETME), at \textasciitilde 201 Ma, ranks among the ‘Big Five’ Phanerozoic mass extinctions. It largely completed the shift from the ‘Paleozoic Evolutionary Fauna’ to the ‘Modern Evolutionary Fauna’ that had been initiated by the end-Permian mass extinction, and may have contributed to the ‘Mesozoic Marine Revolution’ and rise of dinosaurs to dominance in terrestrial environments. In addition, the Triassic–Jurassic transition encompasses a second-order mass extinction during the early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE), at \textasciitilde 181 Ma. The ETME was triggered by Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) magmatism, and the T-OAE by Karoo-Ferrar Large Igneous Province (KFLIP) magmatism, both associated with the stepwise disintegration of the Pangean supercontinent. These events led to major changes in continental and marine habitats, including climatic warming, ocean acidification, and widespread watermass anoxia, that produced a cascade of lethal environmental stresses. This article undertakes a review of the ETME and T-OAE mass extinctions, the large igneous province eruptions that triggered those biotic events, and the web of environmental changes that linked them together.},

Oviparity constrained even gigantic dinosaurs to less than 15 kg at birth; growth through multiple morphologies led to the consumption of different resources at each stage. Such disparity between neonates and adults could have influenced the structure and diversity of dinosaur communities. Here, we quantified this effect for 43 communities across 136 million years and seven continents. We found that megatheropods (more than 1000 kg) such as tyrannosaurs had specific effects on dinosaur community structure. Although herbivores spanned the body size range, communities with megatheropods lacked carnivores weighing 100 to 1000 kg. We demonstrate that juvenile megatheropods likely filled the mesocarnivore niche, resulting in reduced overall taxonomic diversity. The consistency of this pattern suggests that ontogenetic niche shift was an important factor in generating dinosaur community structure and diversity.},

Notably, a single ejecta-rich deposit compositionally linked to the Chicxulub impact is globally distributed at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The temporal match between the ejecta layer and the onset of the extinctions and the agreement of ecological patterns in the fossil record with modeled environmental perturbations (for example, darkness and cooling) lead us to conclude that the Chicxulub impact triggered the mass extinction.},

  abstract = {Synopsis We employ a new comparative method to four cladistic analyses of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs to identify root causes for differences between phylogenetic results. The comparative method is a three‐step procedure that (1) adjusts competing hypotheses so they share equivalent taxonomic scope, (2) isolates the character data relevant to the common problem, and (3) divides relevant character data into shared and novel partitions. It is then possible to quantify the degree of similarity between character data using three indices (ancestor similarity index, character similarity index and character state similarity index). The most parsimonious cladograms generated by the four analyses of tyrannosaurids appear fairly congruent, with two subclades present in all four analyses (Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus versus Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus). A comparative examination of the underlying character data, however, highlights striking differences in character selection and significant differences in character state scores. Character selection and differences in scoring are root causes for phylogenetic incongruence. Comparative analysis reveals the existence of many data‐level differences that remain largely obscured when comparison is limited to the most parsimonious cladograms.},

  abstract = {Fossil bones were once living tissues that demanded internal blood perfusion in proportion to their metabolic requirements. Metabolic rates were primarily associated with bone growth (modeling) in the juvenile stages and with alteration and repair of existing bone affected by weight bearing and locomotion (remodeling) in later stages. This study estimates blood flow rates to the tibia shafts of the Late Cretaceous hadrosaurid Maiasaura peeblesorum, based on the size of the primary nutrient foramina in fossil bones. Foramen size quantitatively reflects arterial size and hence blood flow rate. The results showed that the bone metabolic intensity of juveniles (ca. 1 year old) was greater than fourfold higher than that of 6- to 11-year-old adults. This difference is much greater than expected from standard metabolic scaling and is interpreted as a shift from the high metabolic demands for primary bone modeling in the rapidly growing juveniles to a lower metabolic demand of adults to remodel their bones for repair of microfractures accumulated during locomotion and weight bearing. Large nutrient foramina of adults indicate a high level of cursorial locomotion characteristic of tachymetabolic endotherms. The practical value of these results is that juvenile and adult stages should be treated separately in interspecific analyses of bone perfusion in relation to body mass.},

A newly collected partial skeleton from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, UALVP 60425, represents a small saurolophine with a partial skull (skull length ∼500 mm). It can be referred to Edmontosaurini based on the presence of a postorbital fossa and anteroposteriorly long frontals that lack a dorsally oriented nasal contact and contribute significantly to the orbital margin. Despite its small size and presumed immaturity, UALVP 60425 is assigned to E. regalis based on a horizontal shelf on the postorbital process of the jugal. The deep postorbital fossa that, in part, diagnoses E. regalis is acquired during growth. UALVP 60425 shares many features with the Alaskan Prince Creek saurolophine (Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis); both show consistent anatomical differences in the lacrimal, jugal, and postorbitals from E. annectens throughout their growth series. New data from UALVP 6025 supports referring the Alaskan saurolophine material to Edmontosaurus cf. regalis in the absence of large-sized cranial material from the Prince Creek Formation.},

Here, we present measurements taken from specimens of all 13 species of extant macrophagous lamniforms to generate functions that would allow estimations of body, jaw, and dentition lengths of extinct macrophagous lamniforms from their teeth. These quantitative functions enable us to examine the body size distribution of all known macrophagous lamniform genera over geologic time. Our study reveals that small body size is plesiomorphic for Lamniformes. There are four genera that included at least one member that reached {$>$}6 m during both the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, most of which are endothermic. The largest form of the genus Otodus, O. megalodon (‘megatooth shark’) that reached at least 14 m, is truly an outlier considering that all other known macrophagous lamniforms have a general size limit of 7 m. Endothermy has previously been proposed to be the evolutionary driver for gigantism in Lamniformes. However, we contend that ovoviviparous reproduction involving intrauterine cannibalism, a possible synapomorphy of Lamniformes, to be another plausible driver for the evolution of endothermy achieved by certain lamniform taxa.},

However, the simultaneous measures of prey and predator activity along with timing of predation required to test this assumption have not been available. Here, we used accelerometry data on snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) to determine activity patterns of prey and predators and match these to precise timing of predation. Surprisingly we found that lynx kills of hares were as likely to occur during the day when hares were inactive as at night when hares were active. We also found that activity rates of hares were not related to the chance of predation at daily and weekly scales, whereas lynx activity rates positively affected the diel pattern of lynx predation on hares and their weekly kill rates of hares. Our findings suggest that predator–prey diel activity overlap may not always be a good proxy of predation risk, and highlight a need for examining the link between predation and spatio-temporal behaviour of predator and prey to improve our understanding of how predator–prey behavioural interactions drive predation risk.},

  abstract = {Sexual selection is a key component of evolutionary biology. However, from the very formulation of sexual selection by Darwin, the nature and extent of sexual selection have been controversial. Recently, such controversy has led back to the fundamental question of just what sexual selection is. This has included how we incorporate female-female reproductive competition into sexual or natural selection. In this review, we do four things. First, we examine what we want a definition to do. Second, we define sexual selection: sexual selection is any selection that arises from fitness differences associated with nonrandom success in the competition for access to gametes for fertilization. An important outcome of this is that as mates often also offer access to resources, when those resources are the targets of the competition, rather than their gametes, the process should be considered natural rather than sexual selection. We believe this definition encapsulates both much of Darwin’s original thinking about sexual selection, and much of how contemporary biologists use the concept of sexual selection. Third, we address alternative definitions, focusing in some detail on the role of female reproductive competition. Fourth, we challenge our definition with a number of scenarios, for instance where natural and sexual selection may align (as in some forms of endurance rivalry), or where differential allocation means teasing apart how fecundity and access to gametes influence fitness. In conclusion, we emphasize that whilst the ecological realities of sexual selection are likely to be complex, the definition of sexual selection is rather simple.},

Some of these mistakes correspond to student misunderstandings and are corrected before publication. However, other errors can be found in published papers.

  abstract = {Species distribution model is the term most frequently used in ecological modelling, but other authors used instead predictive habitat distribution model or species-habitat models. A consensual ecological modelling terminology that avoids misunderstandings and takes into account the ecological niche theory does not exist at present. Moreover, different studies differ in the type of niche that is represented by similar distribution models. I propose to use as standard ecological modelling terminology the terms “ecological niche”, “potential niche”, “realized niche” models (for modelling their respective niches), and “habitat suitability map” (for the output of the niche models). Therefore, the user can understand more easily that models always forecast species’ niche and relate more closely the different types of niche models.},

The prevalence of multiple morphs is a challenge to evolutionary theory because a single strategy should prevail unless morphs have exactly equal fitness4,5 or a fitness advantage when rare6,7. We report here the application of an evolutionary stable strategy model to a three-morph mating system in the side-blotched lizard. Using parameter estimates from field data, the model predicted oscillations in morph frequency, and the frequencies of the three male morphs were found to oscillate over a six-year period in the field. The fitnesses of each morph relative to other morphs were non-transitive in that each morph could invade another morph when rare, but was itself invadable by another morph when common. Concordance between frequency-dependent selection and the among-year changes in morph fitnesses suggest that male interactions drive a dynamic 'rock–paper–scissors' game7.},

  abstract = {There are several ecological mechanisms that could account for the origin of sexual dimorphism in a dioecious species that is initially monomorphic. Ecological conditions could favor different characteristics in each sex as a consequence of different ecological or social roles (dimorphic niche). ecological conditions could favor two distinct types of individuals of either sex (bimodal niche), or ecological conditions could favor dimorphism through competition in a manner analogous to ecological character displacement (competitive displacement). A model of a quantitative character evolving under each of these assumptions is introduced and analyzed. If there is a unique equilibrium of the population, as in the case of a dimorphic niche or competitive displacement, the extent of genetic correlation between the sexes does not affect the likelihood of a species evolving a sexual dimorphism. The ecological forces alone will determine whether or not a dimorphism can evolve. If there there are several stable equilibria, as is true for the bimodal niche, then the genetic correlations among the sexes in the trait of interest will determine which equilibrium is reached. In that case, the conditions under which dimorphism will evolve in a species that is initially nearly monomorphic are restrictive.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Palaeodiversity curves are constructed from counts of fossils collected at outcrop and thus potentially biased by variation in the rock record, specifically by the amount of sedimentary rock representative of different time intervals that has been preserved at outcrop. To investigate how much of a problem this poses we have compiled a high-resolution record of marine rock outcrop area in Western Europe for the Phanerozoic and use this to generate a model that predicts the sampled diversity curve. We find that we can predict with high accuracy the variance of the marine genus diversity curve (itself dominated by European taxa) from rock outcrop data and a three-step model of diversity that tracks supercontinent fragmentation, coalescence and fragmentation. The size and position of two of the five major mass extinction spikes are largely predicted by rock outcrop data. We conclude that the long-term trends in taxonomic diversity and the end-Cretaceous extinction are not the result of rock area bias, but cannot rule out that rock outcrop area bias explains many of the short-term rises and falls in sampled diversity that palaeontologists have previously sought to explain biologically.},

The way species are grouped into higher taxa, and how this affects their utility in evolutionary studies is also discussed. Because the fossil record abounds with sampling and preservational biases, the book emphasizes that observed patterns can rarely be taken at face value. It is argued that evolutionary trees, constructed from combining phylogenetic and biostratigraphic data, provide the best approach for investigating patterns of evolution through geologic time.

Often, however, there are sightings of uncertain validity. To date, uncertain sightings have been treated in an ad hoc way, either excluding them from the record or including them as if they were certain. We developed a Bayesian method that formally accounts for such uncertain sightings. The method assumes that valid and invalid sightings follow independent Poisson processes and use noninformative prior distributions for the rate of valid sightings and for a measure of the quality of uncertain sightings. We applied the method to a recently published record of sightings of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis). This record covers the period 1897–2010 and contains 39 sightings classified as certain and 29 classified as uncertain. The Bayes factor in favor of extinction was 4.03, which constitutes substantial support for extinction. The posterior distribution of the time of extinction has 3 main modes in 1944, 1952, and 1988. The method can be applied to sighting records of other purportedly extinct species.},

  abstract = {Ecologists routinely use statistical models to detect and explain interactions among ecological drivers, with a goal to evaluate whether an effect of interest changes in sign or magnitude in different contexts. Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale – whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry – whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modification (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentification of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.},

The next section considers the effects of variation in age structure or growth rates on adult body sizes and sexual size dimorphism. Field data from a crustacean, fish, lizard and mammal show how information on a species' growth and maturation patterns can be used to predict the relationships between male size, female size and sexual size dimorphism expected if a series of samples from the same population simply differed with respect to their ages or growth rates. The last section considers ecological or behavioural factors with different effects on the growth, maturation, survival or movement patterns of the two sexes. This study supports earlier suggestions that information on growth and maturation patterns may be useful, if not essential, for comparative stuthes of sexual size dimorphism in taxa with asymptotic growth after maturity.},

We illustrate these methods by applying them to a sample of 22 Albertosaurus sarcophagus individuals. We show that this sample is too small to provide any confidence in the claim that this species had a “convex” survivorship curve arising from age-specific survival rates that decreased monotonically with age. However, we show that a sample of 50 to 100 individuals has reasonable statistical power to support such a claim. There is evidence for the much weaker claim that average survival rates for ages 2 to 15 were higher than survival rates for later ages. Finally, we describe one way to account for size-dependent fossilization rates and show that a plausible positively-size-dependent fossilization rate results in a substantially non-convex survivorship curve for A. sarcophagus.},

  abstract = {Biotic Immigration Events (BIMEs) record the large-scale dispersal of taxa from one biogeographic area to another and have significantly impacted biodiversity throughout geologic time. BIMEs associated with biodiversity increases have been linked to ecologic and evolutionary processes including niche partitioning, species packing, and higher speciation rates. Yet substantial biodiversity decline has also been documented following BIMEs due to elevated extinction and/or reduced speciation rates. In this review, we develop a conceptual model for biodiversity accumulation that links BIMEs and geographic isolation with local (α) diversity, regional (β) diversity, and global (γ) diversity metrics. Within the model, BIME intervals are characterized by colonization of existing species within new geographic regions and a lack of successful speciation events. Thus, there is no change in γ-diversity, and α-diversity increases at the cost of β-diversity. An interval of regional isolation follows in which lineage splitting results in successful speciation events and diversity increases across all three metrics. Alternation of these two regimes can result in substantial biodiversity accumulation. We tested this conceptual model using a series of case studies from the paleontological record. We primarily focus on two intervals during the Middle through Late Ordovician Period (470–458Ma): the globally pervasive BIMEs during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) and a regional BIME, the Richmondian Invasion. We further test the conceptual model by examining the Great Devonian Interchange, Neogene mollusk migrations and diversification, and the Great American Biotic Interchange. Paleontological data accord well with model predictions. Constraining the mechanisms of biodiversity accumulation provides context for conservation biology. Because α-, β-, and γ-diversity are semi-independent, different techniques should be considered for sustaining various diversity partitions. Maintaining natural migration routes and population sizes among isolated regions are vital to preserving both extant biodiversity and biogeographic pathways requisite for future diversity generation.},

  abstract = {Depositional cycles in fluvial successions are described here as chronostratigraphic packages of strata founded on a laterally extensive, scour-based, amalgamated channel-sand body, overlain by mudrocks, isolated channel fills, avulsion and splay complexes, and paleosols. Ten packages are described from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian-Maastrichtian), one of a succession of clastic wedges filling the Alberta foreland basin in south-central Alberta. The structure of these packages is consistent with the fall-rise-fall cycle of base-level described in other studies, but the package-bounding scours and internal surfaces are discontinuous and difficult to trace in the mudrock-dominated strata. Terrestrial vertebrate fossils are preserved in relatively fossiliferous, facies-independent horizons 1 to 3 m thick that statistically correlate with the stratigraphic position of package scours and surfaces. Fossiliferous horizons formed as a result of attritional accumulation under an optimum, relatively low, regional deposition rate. Not only do these horizons aid in locating package surfaces, but they also provide insight to the interaction of the package-scale, base-level oscillation with the larger-scale fluctuation in accommodation associated with the formation of the clastic wedge. As such, fossiliferous horizons in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation make better boundary markers than do paleosols, splays, coal seams, or even the surfaces associated with package structure. Therefore, the vertebrate fossil record may supply a means of stratigraphically evaluating sections in other locations in which typical sedimentological and architectural cues for surfaces are absent.},

  abstract = {The observed local range of a fossil taxon in a stratigraphic section is almost certainly a truncated version of the true local range. True endpoints are parameters that may be estimated using only the assumption that fossil finds are distributed randomly between them. If thickness is rescaled so that true endpoints lie at 0 and 1, the joint distribution of gap lengths between fossil finds is given by the Dirichlet distribution. Observed ends of the range are maximum likelihood estimators of true endpoints, but they are biased seriously. Extension of the observed range at each end by a distance equal to the average gap length yields unbiased point estimators. Classical statistics can generate confidence intervals for ends of the taxon range; but with Bayesian inference, the probability that true endpoints lie in a certain region can be stated. For a 95\% confidence level (classical) or a 95\% probability (Bayesian), the range extensions exceed the observed range if the range is established on less than six finds; if only two finds are used, such range extensions are an order of magnitude longer than the observed range. Evidently the standard biostratigraphic practice that identifies zonal boundaries as horizons rather than confidence intervals may not be justified at the resolution of typical fossiliferous sections.},

  abstract = {Accelerated biotic turnover during the Late Triassic has led to the perception of an end-Triassic mass extinction event, now regarded as one of the “big five” extinctions. Close examination of the fossil record reveals that many groups thought to be affected severely by this event, such as ammonoids, bivalves and conodonts, instead were in decline throughout the Late Triassic, and that other groups were relatively unaffected or subject to only regional effects. Explanations for the biotic turnover have included both gradualistic and catastrophic mechanisms. Regression during the Rhaetian, with consequent habitat loss, is compatible with the disappearance of some marine faunal groups, but may be regional, not global in scale, and cannot explain apparent synchronous decline in the terrestrial realm. Gradual, widespread aridification of the Pangaean supercontinent could explain a decline in terrestrial diversity during the Late Triassic. Although evidence for an impact precisely at the boundary is lacking, the presence of impact structures with Late Triassic ages suggests the possibility of bolide impact-induced environmental degradation prior to the end-Triassic. Widespread eruptions of flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) were synchronous with or slightly postdate the system boundary; emissions of CO2 and SO2 during these eruptions were substantial, but the contradictory evidence for the environmental effects of outgassing of these lavas remains to be resolved. A substantial excursion in the marine carbon-isotope record of both carbonate and organic matter suggests a significant disturbance of the global carbon cycle at the system boundary. Release of methane hydrates from seafloor sediments is a possible cause for this isotope excursion, although the triggering mechanism and climatic effects of such a release remain uncertain.},

A diverse but poorly preserved clade, edestoids are noted for developing biting teeth at the midline of their jaws. Helicoprion has a continuously growing root to accommodate {$>$}100 crowns that spiraled on top of one another to form a symphyseal whorl supported and laterally braced within the lower jaw. Reconstruction of jaw mechanics shows that individual serrated crowns grasped, sliced, and pulled prey items into the esophagus. A new description and interpretation of Edestus provides insight into the anatomy and functional morphology of another specialized edestoid. Edestus has opposing curved blades of teeth that are segmented and shed with growth of the animal. Set on a long jaw the lower blade closes with a posterior motion, effectively slicing prey across multiple opposing serrated crowns. Further examples of symphyseal whorls among Edestoidae are provided from previously undescribed North American examples of Toxoprion, Campyloprion, Agassizodus, and Sinohelicoprion. The symphyseal dentition in edestoids is associated with a rigid jaw suspension and may have arisen in response to an increase in pelagic cephalopod prey during the Late Paleozoic.

  abstract = {Taphonomy established itself in paleontology primarily as a subdiscipline of paleoecology, but it has evolved into a much broader study of the ways in which preservation affects the fossil record. The past decade has seen a change in emphasis from descriptive taphonomic studies of fossil assemblages to more experimental, process-oriented investigations of necrolysis, stratification, and diagenesis of organic remains in modern environments. These actualistic studies are increasing the sophistication of taphonomic analysis in the fossil record by sharpening the diagnosis of bias in paleontological data and by providing a baseline for quantitative modeling of preservational patterns. The analysis of bias is also expanding into the evaluation of temporal resolution in the fossil record (sample acuity, stratigraphic completeness), and taphonomic research is thus contributing to broad-scale problems in evolution, biogeography, and biostratigraphy. In addition, taphonomic studies are providing new insights into paleoenvironmental reconstruction and into the direct paleobiological significance of post mortem processes such as the behavior of scavengers and the role of dead hardparts in structuring benthic communities. One of taphonomy's most promising new frontiers is comparative analysis applied to different taxonomic groups within assemblages and across environments, tectonic settings, and climatic regimes. All of this currently active research is contributing to a better understanding of the fossil record as the result of a dynamic, evolving, integrated system of biological and sedimentological processes that have both limited and enhanced knowledge of Earth history.},

Although adults commonly fed on dinosaurian megaherbivores, the diet of juvenile tyrannosaurids is largely unknown. Here, we describe a remarkable specimen of a juvenile Gorgosaurus libratus that preserves the articulated hindlimbs of two yearling caenagnathid dinosaurs inside its abdominal cavity. The prey were selectively dismembered and consumed in two separate feeding events. This predator-prey association provides direct evidence of an ontogenetic dietary shift in tyrannosaurids. Juvenile individuals may have hunted small and young dinosaurs until they reached a size when, to satisfy energy requirements, they transitioned to feeding on dinosaurian megaherbivores. Tyrannosaurids occupied both mesopredator and apex predator roles during their life span, a factor that may have been key to their evolutionary success.},

  abstract = {The albertosaurines Albertosaurus sarcophagus and Gorgosaurus libratus are among the best represented tyrannosaurids, known from nearly complete growth series. These specimens provide an opportunity to study mandibular biomechanical properties and tooth morphology to infer changes in feeding behaviour and bite force through ontogeny in tyrannosaurids. Mandibular force profiles reveal that the symphyseal region of albertosaurines is consistently stronger in bending than the mid-dentary region, indicating that the anterior extremity of the jaws played an important role in prey capture and handling through ontogeny. The symphyseal region was better adapted to withstand torsional stresses than in most non-avian theropods, but not to the extent seen in Tyrannosaurus rex, suggesting that albertosaurine feeding behaviour may have involved less bone crushing or perhaps relatively smaller prey than in Tyrannosaurus~rex. The constancy of these biomechanical properties at all known growth stages indicates that although albertosaurines maintained a similar feeding strategy through ontogeny, prey size/type had to change between juvenile and mature individuals. This ontogenetic dietary shift likely happened when individuals reached a mandibular length of ∼58~cm, a size at which teeth shift from ziphodont to incrassate in shape and bite force begins to increase exponentially. The fact that large albertosaurines were capable of generating bite forces equivalent to similar-sized tyrannosaurines suggests that no significant differences in jaw-closing musculature existed between the two clades and that the powerful bite of Tyrannosaurus~rex is the result of its large body size rather than of unique adaptations related to a specialized ecology.},

  abstract = {To develop a widely applicable method to estimate body size in theropods, the scaling relationship between skull length, body length, and body mass was investigated using 13 strictly carnivorous, non-avialan theropod taxa ranging in size from the 1-m Sinosauropteryx prima to the 12-m Tyrannosaurus rex. Body length was obtained from the literature for complete to nearly-complete specimens and body mass was obtained from three-dimensional mathematical slicing of those same specimens to ensure accurate body length-body mass associations. Least-square regressions reveal a tight correlation between skull length and body length (SK-BL) and skull length and body mass (SK-BM). The SK-BL regression is negatively allometric, which indicates that skulls become longer relative to body length with increasing body size. In contrast, the SK-BM regression is positively allometric, indicating that body mass increases faster than skull length with increasing body size. These conclusions confirm that the common practice of scaling isometrically smaller relatives of a given taxon to obtain body length and body mass estimates is not valid. Although predictive equations derived from the regressions fail to predict accurately body size in abelisaurids and juvenile theropods due to their different head/body proportions, they produce accurate body size estimates for theropods of known body size, thus validating their applicability. Body size estimates for Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus, approaching 13 m and 14 tons, suggest that they may have surpassed Tyrannosaurus in size. A revised body size estimate for a large Spinosaurus specimen suggests a much shorter and heavier animal than recently suggested.},

The so-called “ostrich dinosaurs” are credited with maximum speeds less than 60 km/h, and possibly as low as 35 or 40 km/h. Larger bipedal dinosaurs were probably restricted to walking or slow trotting gaits, with maximum speeds in the range 15–20 km/h. Most quadrupedal dinosaurs seem to have been restricted to a walking gait. Stegosaurs and ankylosaurs may have had maximum speeds as low as 6–8 km/h. Sauropods may have attained 12–17 km/h, and some ceratopsians may have been capable of trotting at speeds up to 25 km/h.

Methods We compiled detailed fisheries landings data for this area and combined them with historical accounts to build a picture of change due to fishing activity over the last 200 years. Findings In the early 19th century, prior to the onset of industrial fishing, the Firth of Clyde supported diverse and productive fisheries for species such as herring (Clupea harengus, Clupeidae), cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Gadidae), turbot (Psetta maxima, Scophthalmidae) and flounder (Platichthys flesus, Pleuronectidae). The 19th century saw increased demand for fish, which encouraged more indiscriminate methods of fishing such as bottom trawling. During the 1880s, fish landings began to decline, and upon the recommendation of local fishers and scientists, the Firth of Clyde was closed to large trawling vessels in 1889. This closure remained in place until 1962 when bottom trawling for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus, Nephropidae) was approved in areas more than three nautical miles from the coast. During the 1960s and 1970s, landings of bottomfish increased as trawling intensified. The trawl closure within three nautical miles of the coast was repealed in 1984 under pressure from the industry. Thereafter, bottomfish landings went into terminal decline, with all species collapsing to zero or near zero landings by the early 21st century. Herring fisheries collapsed in the 1970s as more efficient mid-water trawls and fish finders were introduced, while a fishery for mid-water saithe (Pollachius virens, Gadidae) underwent a boom and bust shortly after discovery in the late 1960s. The only commercial fisheries that remain today are for Nephrops and scallops (Pecten maximus, Pectinidae). Significance The Firth of Clyde is a marine ecosystem nearing the endpoint of overfishing, a time when no species remain that are capable of sustaining commercial catches. The evidence suggests that trawl closures helped maintain productive fisheries through the mid-20th century, and their reopening precipitated collapse of bottomfish stocks. We argue that continued intensive bottom trawling for Nephrops with fine mesh nets will prevent the recovery of other species. This once diverse and highly productive environment will only be restored if trawl closures or other protected areas are re-introduced. The Firth of Clyde represents at a small scale a process that is occurring ocean-wide today, and its experience serves as a warning to others.},

  abstract = {Tyrannosaurids are hypothesized to be gregarious, possibly parasocial carnivores engaging in cooperative hunting and extended parental care. A tyrannosaurid (cf. Teratophoneus curriei) bonebed in the late Campanian age Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, nicknamed the Rainbows and Unicorns Quarry (RUQ), provides the first opportunity to investigate possible tyrannosaurid gregariousness in a taxon unique to southern Laramidia. Analyses of the site’s sedimentology, fauna, flora, stable isotopes, rare earth elements (REE), charcoal content and taphonomy suggest a complex history starting with the deaths and transport of tyrannosaurids into a peri-fluvial, low-energy lacustrine setting. Isotopic and REE analyses of the fossil material yields a relatively homogeneous signature indicating the assemblage was derived from the same source and represents a fauna living in a single ecospace. Subsequent drying of the lake and fluctuating water tables simultaneously overprinted the bones with pedogenic carbonate and structurally weakened them through wet-dry cycling. Abundant charcoal recovered from the primary bone layer indicate a low temperature fire played a role in the site history, possibly triggering an avulsion that exhumed and reburied skeletal material on the margin of a new channel with minimal transport. Possible causes of mortality and concentration of the tyrannosaurids include cyanobacterial toxicosis, fire, and flooding, the latter being the preferred hypothesis. Comparisons of the RUQ site with other North American tyrannosaur bonebeds (Dry Island-Alberta; Daspletosaurus horneri-Montana) suggest all formed through similar processes. Combined with ichnological evidence, these tyrannosaur mass-burial sites could be part of an emerging pattern throughout Laramidia reflecting innate tyrannosaurid behavior such as habitual gregariousness.},

Using these methods it has been possible to correlate modern mammalian community structure and habitat. In turn these correlations have been used to infer palaeohabitat from analysis of the structure of extinct mammal communities. We used the cenogram method to construct the body size distribution of both contemporary and pre-European invasion lists of mammal taxa from 52 Australian national parks spanning all major environments. All modern Australian open environments showed a gap in body mass distribution. Historical open environments showed no distinct gap in body mass distribution but had significantly less medium-sized species than closed environments. Large, introduced mammalian predators have been shown to prefer medium-sized prey over large or small prey and to contribute significantly to the extinction of medium-sized species in open environments. Our results are consistent with previous studies which have found that mid-sized mammals are more extinction prone, and this has been suggested to be due to introduced cats and foxes, following the European colonization of Australia. Two methods complementary to cenograms are introduced in this study, which are useful to infer vegetation covertures of fossil localities.},

  abstract = {Aim Various methods are employed to recover patterns of area relationships in extinct and extant clades. The fidelity of these patterns can be adversely affected by sampling error in the form of missing data. Here we use simulation studies to evaluate the sensitivity of an analytical biogeographical method, namely tree reconciliation analysis (TRA), to this form of sampling failure. Location Simulation study. Methods To approximate varying degrees of taxonomic sampling failure within phylogenies varying in size and in redundancy of biogeographical signal, we applied sequential pruning protocols to artificial taxon–area cladograms displaying congruent patterns of area relationships. Initial trials assumed equal probability of sampling failure among all areas. Additional trials assigned weighted probabilities to each of the areas in order to explore the effects of uneven geographical sampling. Pruned taxon–area cladograms were then analysed with TRA to determine if the optimal area cladograms recovered match the original biogeographical signal, or if they represent false, ambiguous or uninformative signals. Results The results indicate a period of consistently accurate recovery of the true biogeographical signal, followed by a nonlinear decrease in signal recovery as more taxa are pruned. At high levels of sampling failure, false biogeographical signals are more likely to be recovered than the true signal. However, randomization testing for statistical significance greatly decreases the chance of accepting false signals. The primary inflection of the signal recovery curve, and its steepness and slope depend upon taxon–area cladogram size and area redundancy, as well as on the evenness of sampling. Uneven sampling across geographical areas is found to have serious deleterious effects on TRA, with the accuracy of recovery of biogeographical signal varying by an order of magnitude or more across different sampling regimes. Main conclusions These simulations reiterate the importance of taxon sampling in biogeographical analysis, and attest to the importance of considering geographical, as well as overall, sampling failure when interpreting the robustness of biogeographical signals. In addition to randomization testing for significance, we suggest the use of randomized sequential taxon deletions and the construction of signal decay curves as a means to assess the robustness of biogeographical signals for empirical data sets.},

  abstract = {Dinosaurs provide excellent opportunities to examine the impact of sampling biases on the palaeodiversity of terrestrial organisms. The stratigraphical and geographical ranges of 847 dinosaurian species are analysed for palaeodiversity patterns and compared to several sampling metrics. The observed diversity of dinosaurs, Theropoda, Sauropodomorpha and Ornithischia, are positively correlated with sampling at global and regional scales. Sampling metrics for the same region correlate with each other, suggesting that different metrics often capture the same signal. Regional sampling metrics perform well as explanations for regional diversity patterns, but correlations with global diversity are weaker. Residual diversity estimates indicate that sauropodomorphs diversified during the Late Triassic, but major increases in the diversity of theropods and ornithischians did not occur until the Early Jurassic. Diversity increased during the Jurassic, but many groups underwent extinction during the Late Jurassic or at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. Although a recovery occurred during the Cretaceous, only sauropodomorphs display a long-term upward trend. The Campanian–Maastrichtian diversity ‘peak’ is largely a sampling artefact. There is little evidence for a gradualistic decrease in diversity prior to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (except for ornithischians), and when such decreases do occur they are small relative to those experienced earlier in dinosaur evolution.

  abstract = {Theropod dinosaurs were, and mammalian carnivores are, the top predators within their respective communities. Beyond that, they seem distinct, differing markedly in body form and ancestry. Nevertheless, some of the same processes that shape mammalian predators and their communities likely were important to dinosaurian predators as well. To explore this, we compared the predatory adaptations of theropod dinosaurs and mammalian carnivores, focusing primarily on aspects of their feeding morphology (skulls, jaws, and teeth). We also examined suites of sympatric species (i.e., ecological guilds) of predatory theropods and mammals, emphasizing species richness and the distribution of body sizes within guilds. The morphological comparisons indicate reduced trophic diversity among theropods relative to carnivorans, as most or all theropods with teeth appear to have been hypercarnivorous. There are no clear analogs of felids, canids, and hyaenids among theropods. Interestingly, theropods parallel canids more so than felids in cranial proportions, and all theropods appear to have had weaker jaws than carnivorans. Given the apparent trophic similarity of theropods and their large body sizes, it was surprising to find that species richness of theropod guilds was as great as or exceeded that observed among mammalian carnivore guilds. Separation by body size appears to be slightly greater among sympatric theropods than carnivorans, but the magnitude of size difference between species is not constant in either group. We suggest that, as in modern carnivoran guilds, smaller theropod species might have adapted to the threats posed by much larger species (e.g., tyrannosaurs) by hunting in groups, feeding rapidly, and avoiding encounters whenever possible. This would have favored improved hunting skills and associated adaptations such as agility, speed, intelligence, and increased sensory awareness.},

Also, we assess the activity relationships within and among guilds. Apart from Neotropical insectivores, guilds exhibited consistent cross-regional activity in relation to body mass. Results indicate that thermoregulation constrains herbivore and insectivore activity (e.g., larger Afrotropical herbivores are \textasciitilde 7 times more likely to be nocturnal than smaller herbivores), while bottom-up processes constrain the activity of carnivores in relation to herbivores, and top-down processes constrain the activity of small omnivores and insectivores in relation to large carnivores’ activity. Overall, diel activity of tropical mammal communities appears shaped by similar processes and constraints among regions reflecting body mass and trophic guilds.},

Within the Mylodontidae, Lestodon armatus is the largest species, with an estimated body mass of more than three tonnes. This work focuses on the enlarged lower caniniforms of L. armatus as possibly exaggerated sexually dimorphic structures. Lower caniniforms from the late Pleistocene of Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia were studied using specimens from seven palaeontological collections. The possible sexual dimorphism in the caniniforms and its implications regarding the existence of sexual selection was assessed through morphometric analyses. The results support the existence of sexual dimorphism in L. armatus. Sexual dimorphism in an exaggerated structure in a large mammal suggests the existence of sexual selection, via competition between males or female mate choice, resulting in the evolution of the dimorphic structure. In L. armatus, the enlarged caniniforms would correspond to males and could have functioned as armaments in intraspecific fights or ornaments for sexual display. Based on observations in extant mammals, a polygynous mating system is proposed as highly probable in L. armatus, although the existence or composition of social groups cannot be certainly determined.},

Preservation of only isolated elements from the Scollard Formation and a scarcity of relevant comparative specimens from the late Maastrichtian in general, hinders taxonomic assignment of these specimens to the genus level.

  abstract = {Tyrannosauridae is a diverse clade of Late Cretaceous theropod dinosaurs that exhibit significant changes in skull morphology through ontogeny. Whereas mature individuals of distinct tyrannosaurid taxa are morphologically disparate, immature individuals have been regarded as morphologically conservative between taxa. An analysis of newly-discovered juvenile material for the sympatric tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and Daspletosaurus torosus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, including two complete skulls of Gorgosaurus and an isolated post-orbital of Daspletosaurus, reveals new information on the anatomy and ontogeny of tyrannosaurids. Although these two taxa were previously considered to be morphologically similar at juvenile stages, this study reveals that some taxonomically diagnostic characteristics are present at early ontogenetic stages and can be used to distinguish these taxa. In light of these diagnostic characteristics, it is discovered that a specimen previously identified as a juvenile Daspletosaurus, TMP 1994.143.1, is in fact assignable to the albertosaurine Gorgosaurus. An in-depth examination of the skull of juvenile Gorgosaurus specimens reveals that the ontogeny of this taxon is generally consistent with that of other tyrannosaurids, exhibiting such changes as an increase in cranium depth, development of cranial ornamentation, and widening of teeth. Furthermore, features considered autapomorphies for Gorgosaurus (e.g., curling of the post-orbital cornual process) and of synapomorphies for the more inclusive clade of Albertosaurinae (Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus) are also shown to be ontogenetically variable.},

  abstract = {North America is known for its rich uppermost Cretaceous record of dinosaur egg remains, although a notable fossil gap exists during the lower Maastrichtian. Here we describe a diverse dinosaur eggshell assemblage from the St. Mary River Formation of southern Alberta that, in conjunction with recently described eggs from the same formation in Montana, helps fill this gap and sheds light on the dinosaur diversity in this poorly fossiliferous formation. Three theropod eggshell types (Continuoolithus cf. C. canadensis, Montanoolithus cf. M. strongorum, and Prismatoolithus cf. P. levis) and one ornithopod (Spheroolithus cf. S. albertensis), are reported from Albertan exposures of the St. Mary River Formation, increasing the ootaxonomic diversity of the formation from two to five ootaxa. The taxonomic composition of the eggshell assemblage is consistent with the dinosaurian fauna known from the St. Mary River Formation based on skeletal remains. Spheroolithus eggshells constitute the majority of identifiable eggshells in our assemblage, a trend also observed in several other Upper Cretaceous formations from North America. Continuoolithus is shown to be synonymous with Spongioolithus, thus expanding the Maastrichtian geographic range of the ootaxon to include Utah. The St. Mary River eggshell assemblage supports a general trend of increase in eggshell thickness among theropod ootaxa from the uppermost Santonian through the Maastrichtian, which is inferred to reflect an increase in body size among some clades of small theropods through the Upper Cretaceous. Eggshell preservation in the St. Mary River Formation may be related to the semiarid climatic and environmental conditions that prevailed.},

However, diagnostic material from contemporaneous deposits further north in Alberta (Canada) and Montana (USA) has yet to be documented. Here we report the discovery of a new tyrannosaurine tyrannosaurid from the midCampanian Foremost Formation of Alberta, Thanatotheristes degrootorum gen. et. sp. nov, which helps fill this gap. The new tyrannosaurine, diagnosed by five autapomorphies, is found to be the sister taxon to the late Campanian genus Daspletosaurus. Thanatotheristes is distinct from Daspletosaurus based on several features, and lacks at least two apomorphies of the latter taxon. Together, these taxa form the newly established Daspletosaurini, a clade of long-, deep-snouted tyrannosaurines endemic to northern Laramidia during the Campanian. Our study demonstrates that Tyrannosauridae is composed of several geographically-segregated clades rather than a series of monogeneric successive sister taxa as recovered by previous studies. The geographic segregation of tyrannosaurid clades within North America provides renewed evidence for provinciality among large theropods during the Late Cretaceous.},

Although several large subadult and adult individuals of this taxon are known, only one juvenile individual, TMP 1994.143.1, has been identified. This specimen has played a key role in the idea that juvenile tyrannosaurid individuals are difficult to differentiate among species. Here the taxonomic affinity of TMP 1994.143.1 is reassessed in light of a juvenile tyrannosaurine postorbital recently discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. Anatomical comparisons and phylogenetic analyses reveal that TMP 1994.143.1 is referable to the albertosaurine Gorgosaurus libratus, whereas the new postorbital belongs to a small juvenile Daspletosaurus. This taxonomic reassignment of TMP 1994.143.1 results in the juvenile ontogenetic stage of Daspletosaurus being known only from two isolated cranial elements. The new postorbital provides insights into early Daspletosaurus ontogeny, revealing that the cornual process developed earlier or faster than in other tyrannosaurids. Although some ontogenetic changes in the postorbital are found to be unique to Daspletosaurus, overall changes are most consistent with those of other large tyrannosaurines. Our results also show that diagnostic features develop early in ontogeny, such that juveniles of different tyrannosaurid species are easier to differentiate than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Known from dozens of specimens discovered since the early 20th century, Gorgosaurus libratus has arguably contributed more than any other taxon to our understanding of the life history of tyrannosaurids. However, juvenile material for this taxon is rare. Here, we describe two small, articulated Gorgosaurus specimens (skull lengths of ca. 500 mm) that help advance our knowledge of the anatomy and ontogeny of this taxon and of tyrannosaurids in general. The new specimens exhibit hallmark juvenile tyrannosaurid features, including long, low, and narrow skulls, large circular orbits, absent or incipient cranial ornamentation, ziphodont dentition, and an overall gracile skull frame. Comparison with other Gorgosaurus specimens of various ontogenetic stages allows for an examination of the timing of morphological changes that occurred through ontogeny in this taxon relative to other tyrannosaurids. Of particular note, Gorgosaurus and the larger Tyrannosaurus rex are found to have experienced similar ontogenetic transformations at similar percent skull length relative to the large known individuals for each respective taxon but at different absolute body sizes and biological ages, occurring at a larger size and older age in Tyrannosaurus than in Gorgosaurus. These results suggest a dissociation between the timing of cranial development and body size in tyrannosaurids. Finally, the recognition of ontogenetically invariant characters in Gorgosaurus makes it possible to determine the taxonomic identity of previously misidentified specimens.},

Here we describe two improvements to Marshall's method. First, we show that more precise estimates of the position of such a boundary may be obtained using range extensions with confidence levels of less than 50\% (e.g., 20\%). Second, we introduce a new method of calculating confidence intervals that explicitly takes into account the position of the highest fossil find. Incorporating these improvements leads to confidence intervals for simulated data sets that are approximately four times more precise than those obtained by using Marshall's (1995) original method and approximately twice as precise as those using other published methods. We provide a look-up table that shows for different numbers of taxa the confidence level that should be used to maximize the precision of the estimated position of the extinction boundary, while ensuring that the boundary still lies within the stratigraphic interval bounded by at least one range extension. Unlike some other methods, our method is nonparametric and does not make the restrictive assumption of uniform preservation and recovery potential. We apply the method to Macellari's (1986) ammonite data from the late Cretaceous of Seymour Island, Antarctica.},

The description of this taxon provides insight into evolutionary mode in Tyrannosaurinae, lending strength to previous hypotheses of anagenesis within Daspletosaurus and increasing the resolution with which the evolution of this lineage can be reconstructed.

  abstract = {The Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada, is among the best-studied paleoecosystems in North America. However, its microvertebrate paleocommunity structure is relatively poorly known, partly because it lacks the abundant microsites of other Upper Cretaceous deposits of Alberta. An unusual microsite (FTS-2) from the Horsethief Member of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is described that produces abundant anuran and troodontid material, alongside perinatal material from ornithischians and tyrannosaurs. Anuran specimens representing a minimum of two separate taxa and a metatherian molar suggest that these components of the fauna were more diverse than currently recognized. The assemblage is similar to three other North American sites that produce abundant troodontid teeth alongside perinatal dinosaurs. However, environmental and taphonomic conditions of these sites vary, supporting the notion of mixed biotic and abiotic factors driving the association of troodontids alongside perinates. In part, this may stem from similar nesting preferences between troodontids and other dinosaurs, as material collected from all three sites suggests proximity to troodontid nesting sites. Sites such as FTS-2 are important for revealing the rare and small components of paleoecosystems, and hold promise for revealing interactions between these parts of the fauna.},

A previously published data base consisting of 649 individuals (counted at the family level) was used to establish statistically fundamental associations between the vertebrate faunal elements and the fluvial architectural elements in which they were found. In the Hell Creek, preservation is not equally distributed among the various fluvial architectural elements. Flood-plain and channel deposits preserve the preponderance of the Hell Creek dinosaur fauna. Articulated fossils most commonly occur within floodplain and point-bar deposits. Floodplain and related deposits, however, preserve the highest dinosaur faunal diversities. The dinosaur sample inferred to be most representative of the original dinosaurian assemblage structure, therefore, is obtained from floodplain and genetically related deposits. These yield eight families of dinosaurs represented in the following proportions: Ceratopsidae, 61\%; Hadrosauridae, 23\%; Ornithomimidae, 5\%; Tyrannosauridae, 4\%; Hypsilophodontidae, 3\%; Dromaeosauridae, 2\%; Pachycephalosauridae, 1\%; and Troodontidae, 1\%. Among these groups, dromaeosaurs and troodontids are represented only by teeth, a circumstance attributed at least in part to thin-walled bones whose potential for preservation in an active fluvial system is jeopardized. Ornithomimids constitute 5\% of the total assemblage, which makes them the third most common dinosaur in this study. Their relatively high abundance may suggest a herbivorous dietary preference.},

From earlier studies, South Carolina alligators reached sexual maturity at an older age and larger body size than alligators found elsewhere. Delayed breeding at larger size in South Carolina may be related more to social dominance than to growth rates. An understanding of age and size relations are essential if alligators are to be managed effectively.},

For example, Bergmann’s rule predicts that homeothermic animals, including birds and mammals, inhabiting cooler climates are generally larger than close relatives from warmer climates. The modern world, however, lacks the comparative data needed to evaluate such macroecological rules rigorously. Here, we test for Bergmann’s rule in Mesozoic dinosaurs and mammaliaforms that radiated within relatively temperate global climate regimes. We develop a phylogenetic model that accounts for biases in the fossil record and allows for variable evolutionary dispersal rates. Our analysis also includes new fossil data from the extreme high-latitude Late Cretaceous Arctic Prince Creek Formation. We find no evidence for Bergmann’s rule in Mesozoic dinosaurs or mammaliaforms, the ancestors of extant homeothermic birds and mammals. When our model is applied to thousands of extant dinosaur (bird) and mammal species, we find that body size evolution remains independent of latitude. A modest temperature effect is found in extant, but not in Mesozoic, birds, suggesting that body size evolution in modern birds was influenced by Bergmann’s rule during Cenozoic climatic change. Our study provides a general approach for studying macroecological rules, highlighting the fossil record’s power to address longstanding ecological principles.},

Soft-tissue considerations are important for two major reasons: (1)Soft tissues often havekorphogenetic over skeletaltissues, and (.2), such considerations often lie at the base of numerous paleobiological inferences. Furthermore, soft-tissue analysis can provide causal hypotheses of phylogenetic character correlation. A methodology for reconstructing soft anatomy in fossils - the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket approach - is proposed here. This method makes explicit reference to at least the first two extant outgroups of the fossil taxon of interest. It is based firmly on the relation of biological homology, provides a means of rigorously establishing the limits of our inferences, and allows construction of a hierarchy of inference. The approach can be applied to virtually any unpresemed trait of a fossil taxon with little or no modification.},

  abstract = {Sauropterygia was a taxonomically and ecomorphologically diverse clade of Mesozoic marine reptiles spanning the Early Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. Sauropterygians are traditionally divided into two groups representing two markedly different body plans – the short-necked, durophagous Placodontia and the long-necked Eosauropterygia – whereas Saurosphargidae, a small clade of armoured marine reptiles, is generally considered as the sauropterygian sister-group. However, the early evolutionary history of sauropterygians and their phylogenetic relationships with other groups within Diapsida are still incompletely understood. Here, we report a new saurosphargid from the Early Triassic (Olenekian) of South China – Prosaurosphargis yingzishanensis gen. et sp. nov. – representing the earliest known occurrence of the clade. An updated phylogenetic analysis focussing on the interrelationships among diapsid reptiles recovers saurosphargids as nested within sauropterygians, forming a clade with eosauropterygians to the exclusion of placodonts. Furthermore, a clade comprising Eusaurosphargis and Palatodonta is recovered as the sauropterygian sister-group within Sauropterygomorpha tax. nov. The phylogenetic position of several Early and Middle Triassic sauropterygians of previously uncertain phylogenetic affinity, such as Atopodentatus, Hanosaurus, Majiashanosaurus, and Corosaurus, is also clarified, elucidating the early evolutionary assembly of the sauropterygian body plan. Finally, our phylogenetic analysis supports the placement of Testudines and Archosauromorpha within Archelosauria, a result strongly corroborated by molecular data, but only recently recovered in a phylogenetic analysis using a morphology-only dataset. Our study provides evidence for the rapid diversification of sauropterygians in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction event and emphasises the importance of broad taxonomic sampling in reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among extinct taxa.},

  abstract = {Fossil bone microanalyses reveal the ontogenetic histories of extinct tetrapods, but incomplete fossil records often result in small sample sets lacking statistical strength. In contrast, a histological sample of 50 tibiae of the hadrosaurid dinosaur Maiasaura peeblesorum allows predictions of annual growth and ecological interpretations based on more histologic data than any previous large sample study. Tibia length correlates well (R2{$>$}0.9) with diaphyseal circumference, cortical area, and bone wall thickness, thereby allowing longitudinal predictions of annual body size increases based on growth mark circumference measurements. With an avian level apposition rate of 86.4 μm/day, Maiasaura achieved over half of asymptotic tibia diaphyseal circumference within its first year. Mortality rate for the first year was 89.9\% but a seven year period of peak performance followed, when survivorship (mean mortality rate=12.7\%) was highest. During the third year of life, Maiasaura attained 36\% (x=1260 kg) of asymptotic body mass, growth rate was decelerating (18.2 μm/day), cortical vascular orientation changed, and mortality rate briefly increased. These transitions may indicate onset of sexual maturity and corresponding reallocation of resources to reproduction. Skeletal maturity and senescence occurred after 8 years, at which point the mean mortality rate increased to 44.4\%. Compared with Alligator, an extant relative, Maiasaura exhibits rapid cortical increase early in ontogeny, while Alligator cortical growth is much lower and protracted throughout ontogeny. Our life history synthesis of Maiasaura utilizes the largest histological sample size for any extinct tetrapod species thus far, demonstrating how large sample microanalyses strengthen paleobiological interpretations.},

  abstract = {Fossil deposits with exceptional preservation (“lagerstätten”) provide important details not typically preserved in the fossil record, such that they hold an outsized influence on our understanding of biodiversity and evolution. In particular, the potential bias imparted by this so-called “lagerstätten effect” remains a critical, but underexplored aspect of reconstructing evolutionary relationships. Here, we quantify the amount of phylogenetic information available in the global fossil records of 1,327 species of non-avian theropod dinosaurs, Mesozoic birds, and fossil squamates (e.g., lizards, snakes, mosasaurs), and then compare the influence of lagerstätten deposits on phylogenetic information content and taxon selection in phylogenetic analyses to other fossil-bearing deposits. We find that groups that preserve a high amount of phylogenetic information in their global fossil record (e.g., non-avian theropods) are less vulnerable to a “lagerstätten effect” that leads to disproportionate representation of fossil taxa from one geologic unit in an evolutionary tree. Additionally, for each taxonomic group, we find comparable amounts of phylogenetic information in lagerstätten deposits, even though corresponding morphological character datasets vary greatly. Finally, we unexpectedly find that ancient sand dune deposits of the Late Cretaceous Gobi Desert of Mongolia and China exert an anomalously large influence on the phylogenetic information available in the squamate fossil record, suggesting a “lagerstätten effect” can be present in units not traditionally considered lagerstätten. These results offer a phylogenetics-based lens through which to examine the effects of exceptional fossil preservation on biological patterns through time and space, and invites further quantification of evolutionary information in the rock record.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of large datasets and increasing data availability have led to the emergence of data-driven paleontological studies, which reveal an unprecedented picture of evolutionary history. However, the fast-growing quantity and complication of data modalities make data processing laborious and inconsistent, while also lacking clear benchmarks to evaluate data collection and generation, and the performances of different methods on similar tasks. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has become widely practiced across scientific disciplines, but not so much to date in paleontology where traditionally manual workflows have been more usual. In this study, we review {$>$}70 paleontological AI studies since the 1980s, covering major tasks including micro- and macrofossil classification, image segmentation, and prediction. These studies feature a wide range of techniques such as Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), neural networks, transfer learning, and many other machine learning methods to automate a variety of paleontological research workflows. Here, we discuss their methods, datasets, and performance and compare them with more conventional AI studies. We attribute the recent increase in paleontological AI studies most to the lowering of the entry bar in training and deployment of AI models rather than innovations in fossil data compilation and methods. We also present recently developed AI implementations such as diffusion model content generation and Large Language Models (LLMs) that may interface with paleontological research in the future. Even though AI has not yet been a significant part of the paleontologist's toolkit, successful implementation of AI is growing and shows promise for paradigm-transformative effects on paleontological research in the years to come.},

  abstract = {The impact of sexual selection on the evolution of birds has been widely acknowledged. Although sexual selection has been hypothesized as a driving force in the occurrences of numerous morphological features across theropod evolution, this hypothesis has yet to be comprehensively tested due to challenges in identifying the sex of fossils and by the limited sample size. Confuciusornis sanctus is arguably the best-known early avialan and is represented by thousands of well-preserved specimens from the Early Cretaceous Jehol lagerstätte, which provides us with a chance to decipher the strength of sexual selection on extinct vertebrates. Herein, we present a morphometric study of C. sanctus based on the largest sample size of this taxon collected up to now. Our results indicate that the characteristic elongated paired rectrices is a sexually dimorphic trait and statistically robust inferences of the sexual dimorphism in size, shape, and allometry that have been established, providing the earliest known sexual dimorphism in avian evolution. Our findings suggest that sexual selection, in conjunction with natural selection, does act upon body size and limb length ratio in early birds, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of the role of sexual selection in large-scale phylogenetic evolution.},

Here we report on a new darwinopteran pterosaur that inhabited a unique forest ecosystem from the Jurassic of China. The new species exhibits the oldest record of palmar (or true) opposition of the pollex, which is unprecedented for pterosaurs and represents a sophisticated adaptation related to arboreal locomotion. Principal-coordinate analyses suggest an arboreal lifestyle for the new species but not for other closely related species from the same locality, implying a possible case of ecological niche partitioning. The discovery adds to the known array of pterosaur adaptations and the history of arborealism in vertebrates. It also adds to the impressive early bloom of arboreal communities in the Jurassic of China, shedding light on the history of forest environments.},

  abstract = {Mosasaurs are large, carnivorous aquatic lizards with a global distribution that lived during the Late Cretaceous. After 200 years of scientific study, new mosasaur species are still being discovered as new localities are explored and specimens collected long ago are reevaluated using modern standards of species delimitation. Even so, the phylogenetic positions of many key taxa are unresolved and therefore our understanding of mosasaur macroevolution is muddled. Here, we describe a new genus and species of mosasaurine mosasaur comprising a partial skull and skeleton from the Pembina Member of the Pierre Shale Formation in Cavalier County, North Dakota. The lower bound on the age of the specimen is 80.04 ±0.11 Ma, provided by the underlying bentonite bed. Its skull and jaws are nearly complete, and the postcranial skeleton preserves seven cervical vertebrae with three hypapophyseal peduncles, 11 ribs, and five anterior dorsal vertebrae. The new specimen was scored into a modified version of an existing phylogenetic matrix of Mosasauroidea and was recovered in a polytomy with Clidastes; however, given that its morphology is significantly different from that of Clidastes, we refer it to a new genus and species, Jormungandr walhallaensis. Notably, this new taxon shares a mosaic of features seen in both basal (e.g., Clidastes; high dental counts) and derived (e.g., Mosasaurus; subrectangular quadrate) mosasaurines, in addition to possessing its own unique suite of autapomorphies. Given that it possesses morphology intermediate between Clidastes and Plotosaurini, we suspect that future analyses of mosasaur phylogeny, following the addition of new characters and taxa, will recover Jormungandr as transitional between them. Its occurrence increases the known diversity of mosasaurs from the Pembina Member and is the earliest mosasaur to possess autapomorphies of Plotosaurini. Finally, we also analyzed the matrix using different outgroups to test their effect on tree topology and resolution, and found that including multiple nonmosasauroid anguimorphs increased resolution, but not support, of mosasaurid ingroup relationships.},

After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and data-deficient species.},
