Meagan Gilbert was raised on a cattle ranch in the [[Cypress Hills]] north of [[Eastend]], [[Saskatchewan]] where the landscape and its many earthly treasures profoundly shaped her passion for science at an early age. This interest was fostered by proximity to the T.rex Discovery Centre, where as a teen she worked as a tour guide and paleontology volunteer with the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]]. She completed her BSc in paleontology and geology (2012) and PhD (2019) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. Meagan is now a Research Geologist at the Saskatchewan Geological Survey with expertise in Upper [[Cretaceous]] to [[Paleogene]] vertebrate paleontology, stratigraphy, biostratigraphy and depositional systems.
