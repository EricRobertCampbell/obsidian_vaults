## 1 Abstract
> The world is demanding that organizations are accountable for the data they collect, how they manage the data, and how they use personal information to protect and respect the rights of individuals. A structured privacy program, integrated with the AI governance, exhibits an organization’s thoughtful and intentional plan to protect personal information and the rights of individuals.

> Since privacy is a subject of global importance, organizations can no longer ignore the requirements necessary to protect personal information imposed by laws, regulations, and industry best practices. As governments continue to impose tighter laws and regulations, consumers continue to demand more protection from organizations they choose to entrust with their information.

> Consequently, organizations must meet these demands through placement of greater controls, processes (Privacy by Design), and procedures on information under their custodial control. The people in charge of  With so many spheres of influence and pressure, global privacy and business teams must now seek to track, manage, and monitor the dynamic changes that appear to occur continuously in order to maintain and nurture the trust with their ecosystem.

> **Companies must build trust by being accountable for their technology and the data under their control, and also implementing strong privacy and AI governance practices. And “data practitioners” have a key role to play!**

## 2 Summary
- [[Francois-Xavier (FX) Jeannet]]
- Trust is the crucial currency to companies must use to engage with ..
- Transparency is key
- When to collect ( and destroy) data
- Lots of categories:
	- Customers
	- Employees (your people)
	- Pareners and vendors
	- Regulators
- All are affected by your data choices
- Some proposed legislation: [[Law 25]] (QC), [[C-26]] and [[C-27]] (modernization of [[PIPEDA]])
- The law is already in effect in QC - if you have data from residents there you are already required to cover this
- Concerns:
	- Privacy breackes
	- Profiling and manipulation
	- Re-identification and de-anonymization
	- Lack of control
- [[Trustworthy AI Framework]] - [[Deloitte]]
- [[Privacy preserving AI]]
	- [[Fully Homomorphic Encryption]]
	- [[Federated Learning]]
		- E.g. a model is sent to a bunch of hospitals and learns from them but only the model leaves the hospital, not the data
	- [[Synthetic data]]
		- Train on fake data that looks in some way like the actual data
- [[Privacy by Design]]
