## Summary

## Abstract
```
The Eocene to Miocene Cypress Hills Formation (CHF) spans 28 million years, forming the conglomeratic caprock of the Cypress Hills plateau in southwestern Saskatchewan. The formation records one of the last significant sedimentation events in the western plains of North America at a time of major global climate fluctuations. The CHF contains the only high latitude, non-polar mammalian fossil assemblage known in Canada, spanning the Late Eocene to Early Miocene (Uintan to Hemingfordian land mammal ages). The Late Eocene (Chadronian 2) Calf Creek Locality is the most prolific Paleogene multitaxonomic bonebed in Canada, with numerous field campaigns producing a robust collection of approximately 60 fossil vertebrate families. This includes various carnivores and creodonts (ie. Hyaenodon horridus, Hesperocyon regarius, and Daphoenus sp.), early horses and tapirs (Mesohippus westoni, Mesohippus propinquus, Miohippus grandis, Colodon occidentalis), small rhinos and deer (Hyracodon priscidens, Leptomeryx sp.), various “insectivores”, brontotheres (Megacerops coloradensis, M. kuwagatarninus), and numerous freshwater fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Presented is a detailed sedimentologic and paleoenvironmental profile of the Calf Creek Locality, serving as a foundation for further studies that may be conducted utilizing the sites extensive collections. A paleoenvironmental reconstruction is accomplished using cenograms, a graphic plot of mammalian body size of each species in a community excluding chiroptera and carnivora. The resulting shape of the cenogram can be interpreted based on their slope and continuity, providing insight into paleoclimate and paleoenvironment. This study is part of a larger ongoing work to establish a detailed regional stratigraphic and environmental framework to unravel the notorious complexity of the CHF deposits, which host one of the most significant Cenozoic mammalian faunas in Canada.
