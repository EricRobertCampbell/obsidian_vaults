## Abstract
```

```

## Summary
```
Brief overview of the geology of Dinosaur Provincial Park, including an explanation of the different geological groups present and an idea of the different paleoecologies that they represent. It ends with a section on areas for future research.
```

## Notes
- Ascending order: bedrock exposures at [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] consist of 
	- Upper 20m of the [[Oldman Formation]]
	- Entire [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] (70m)
	- Lowermost 20m of the [[Bearpaw Formation]]
- ![[20230305_094001.jpg]]
- Exposed [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] represent the upper half of the [[Belly River Group]]
- Apparently there's some confusion about names of the different groups and what exactly they represent

## Physiography and Structure
- Combination of
	- bedrock structure
	- glacial history
	- modern weathering
	  has influences the exposures throughout the park
- Modern exposures dip toward the NW (avg. slope 0.15%)
- Dip is consistent with gently westward dipping structure of all [[Upper Cretaceous]] strata int h plains region
- Dips more strongly (0.44%) in the southern and southeastern portions of the park due to proximity with the [[Sweetgrass-Bow Island Arch]] - a northeastward-plunging structural high that was actuve during the [[Laramide Orogeny]]
- Rate of erosion is high - 4mm / year on average
- [[Smectite]]-rich [[Sandstone|Sandstones]] and [[Mudstone|Mudstones]] offer little resistance to rain, &c.

## Lithostratigraphy
- Complete [[Belly River Group]] (outcrop and subsurface) is about 280m thick and consists of the
	- [[Foremost Formation]] - 170m
	- [[Oldman Formation]] - 40m
	- [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] - 70m
- [[Foremost Formation]]
	- Paralic to non-marine [[Foremost Formation]] overlies marine shales of the [[Pakowski Formation]] 
	- Includes the [[McKay Coal Zone]]  and [[Taber Coal Zone]]
	- Overlying, stacked [[Paleochannels]] of the [[Herronton Sandstone Zone]]
	- Locally thick zones of stacked shoreface sandstones indicate that the shoreline shifted episodically, rather than continuously, across southwestern [[Alberta]]
- [[Oldman Formation]]
	- Made up of light-coloured alluvial [[Sandstone]]s and [[Mudstone]]
	- Records the maximum regression of the [[Western Interior Seaway]] during the [[Campanian]]
- [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] (DPF)
	- sandy to muddy
	- alluvial, estuarine, paralic facies
	- Lower sandy zone ([[Paleochannels]] deposits) and upper upper muddy section cumination in the [[Lethbridge Coal Zone]]
	- Sombre grey, brown, and green compared to the light-colored sediments of the [[Oldman Formation]]
	- [[Dinosaur Park Formation|DPF]] sandstones are muffy and immature with a low [[Quartz]] / [[Chert]] ratio
	- Paleoflow was generally to the southwest
- Occurrence and preservation of vertebrate fossils are different between the [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]].
- Vertebrate microfossil bonebeds are present in both
	- Tend to be in splay sandstones in the [[Oldman Formation]]
	- [[Paleochannels|Paleochannel]] lag deposits in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation|DPF]]
	 - Articulated and associated skeletal remains are rare in the [[Oldman Formation]] but abundant in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]], where they are preserved with soft tissue
 - Vertebrate macrofossil bonebeds are more abundant in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]

## Chronostratigraphy and Biostratigraphy
- Exposed section of the park spans app. 2.3 My, ranging from 76.5 Ma at the top of the [[Oldman Formation]] to 74.8 Ma near the base of the [[Bearpaw Formation]]

## Regional Sequence-Stratigraphy Framework
- [[Foremost Formation]] reflects a major phase of basin-ward progradation for the [[Belly River Group]]
- Complex relationship through time between sediment supply and accomodations
- [[Oldman Formation]] records the maximum basin-ward extend of the [[Belly River Group]] non-marine clastics
	- maximum late [[Campanian]] drop in relative sea level
	- Most likely corresponds to a eustatic drop

# Regional Correlations
- Ubiquitous presence of [[Baculites compresus (robinsoni)]] in the lower half of the [[Bearpaw Formation]] across southern [[Alberta]] -> top of the [[Belly River Group]] regarded as a chronostratigraphic datum extending east-west across southern [[Alberta]]

## Depositional Environments
- [[Belly River Group]] consistes largely of non-marine facies and a modest component of paralic and marine facies

### [[Oldman Formation]] Paleoenvironments
- Sandstone bodies typically comprise channel and spay facies
- Shallow, high-velocity, ephemeral flows

### [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] Paeloenvironments
- sandstones usu. occur as laterally extensive paleochannel deposits
- Fine0grained units consits of grey, brown, and green organic-rich mudstones and bentonites
- Ironstone horizons are common and often mark the basal surfaces of mustone units in  stacked sequence
- Discrete bentonite beds (green - white) are the remiains of altered volcanic ashes
- Typically occur in association with mudsone sequences
- [[Lethbridge Coal Zone]] forms the upper 15m of the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]
- Abundance of heterolithic paleochannel deposits throughout the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] indicate that the paleochannel flow velocitities frequently varied

### Interpretation of [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] Fine-Grained Facies
- Poorly-drained, organic rich paleoenvironments
- Presence of coal -> waterlogged and swampt conditions as the [[Bearpaw Sea]] continued to flood into Southern [[Alberta]].
- Estuarine environment
