## 1 Abstract
> How are large language models guided to find applicable data?  How do chat bots and copilots know what information is relevant based on human questions?  Vector databases are a crucial component for building AI applications by contextualizing and embedding data. They make it easy to store and search embeddings, which is essential for creating AI-based semantic searches or chat based applications. If you're trying to deploy Chat GPT over your own internal Data, vectorizing this data can offer significant improvements in the accuracy and retrieval performance of the data needed for AI generated responses. Come learn about the different options for vector databases and how to easily deploy your own.
