## #1 - Loyalty Programs
- Average Canadian - 13.4 loyalty programs
- What people want:
	- tiered experiences
	- attainable rewards
	- multi-purpose programs
- Where to start:
	- Reward higher point multipliers based on years of relationship with the brokerage - also, discounts to local shops and partners
	- Education: rewards points for consumers whho take training courses, download materials, attend webinars and install preventative devides in their home
	- Adoption: reward points for downloading the insurance application or opting for paperless
	- Referrals and Reviews - reward points to clients who refer firnds and family to get a quote or leave a review on Google
- Point donation options - e.g. take your unused options to a charity or something

## #2 - Rebrand and Reposition
online channels allow for speed and flexibility for brands to reinvent themselves - e.g. new logo on the website even when the physical stuff is unchanged
- Ghost brand - you have an online name / whatever that has no physical location
- Also: each branch can separately bid for keywords, leading to your company appearing multiple times on the results page for a Google search

## #3 - Direct Mail
Postcard marketing has the highest response rate (4.4%) when compared to digital marketing (0.12%)
- Apparently these stats are from Canada Post
- 81% of Canadians read direct mail right away
- 50% of direct mail clients went on to purchase the product within 6 months
- 71% of direct mail gets read for longer than 1 minute
- 92% of direct mail recipients will engage with the brand online
- Fake written letter
- Why it works:
	- Targeted
	- Cost-effective (about $0.2 per piece of mail)
	- fully customizable (apparently? Some parts here are a bit dodgy)
	- no opt-in needed (no consent needed in contrast for emails)

## #4 - Gamification
Companies that use gamification are 7x more profitable than those that do not use gamified elements at work - whether with employees or consumers
- Employee gamification stats
	- 90% of employees are more productive when they use gamification
	- 69% of workers are more likely to stay are a compnay for 3+ years when tasks are gamified
	- 72% of people believe that gamification inspires them to work harder

## #5 - Hyperpersonalization
91% of consumers are more likely to shop with brands who recognize, remember, and provide relevant offers and whatnot
- Segmentation: here are the people I want to target, here are the ones that I don't
- Personalization: sending a specific message to a group of user
- Hyper personalization: sending a message that is personal to a specific user / customer
	- Runs the risk of looking creepy
