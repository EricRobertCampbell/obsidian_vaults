## 1 Abstract
> LLMs are powerful tools that have revolutionized the field of AI. However, they often struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information. In this talk, we will explore how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address these challenges by incorporating relevant and real-time knowledge from external databases. Attendees will gain insights into the fundamentals of RAG, its transformative impact on LLMs, and its diverse real-world applications.
