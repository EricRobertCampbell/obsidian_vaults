## 1 Introduction to Market Foundation
- In market foundations, we review the tools and existing data to lay the foundation for the market development we'll do later
- You have data and learnings - maybe just not codified and organized
- "Stop Improvising your way to market" and "start acting with intent"
- Properly resource any hypotheses that you're testing
- Plan before executing
- First step: evaluate your team
- What is the resource budget?
- You have to resource market development correctly
- What is your existing talent roadmap (i.e. which people will you have to hire once you scale?)
- Then look at the marketing and sales processes
	- What worked, what didn't, and why?
- What is your sales and marketing collateral? What pieces of collateral do you have and what do you still need?
- Take time to be critical and try not to take it personally
- Don't avoid the tough conversations - use the data to get better
- Don't avoid the elephant in the room - "[[Hug the Elephant]]"
## 2 Resource Review - People
### 2.1 Critical Concepts
- Focus on the people
- Goal: develop your market development budget
- How many person-hours can you devote to market development?
- What is the budget and who will lead the efforts?
- Often a lack of accountability for this in startups - e.g. "*We* will start the email campaign" translates to no one actually does it
- There has to be a single person responsible for the effort
- Need accountability
- In order to have expectations we need to manage expectations
- Break down everyone and see who is in the Product Team and who in the Market Team
- Market Team:
	- This is where you have the market development budget
- For each team member:
	- What are their skills?
	- What are they hoping to achieve?
	- What can you count on them to do when it comes to go-to-market strategy
- Who will own the market development process?
- What relevant skills and times do they have?
- Both of those together constitute the Market Development budget
- If you have someone doing that who doesn't have sales experience, you probably won't get those professional results -> set expectations appropriately
- Talent Roadmap - what breaks as you start to add in customers?
- Often Market Development
- You're responsible for the whole customer funnel
- Probably will need to specialize -> hire new people
- Don't want to get in the state of the seams breaking *and then* go look to hire someone
- Hasty hires are often trouble
- Talent roadmap comes first to avoid this!
- If you don't have the right people you won't get the right results
- Seams will break -> plan for them
- Hire toward your values instead of quickly towards your needs
### 2.2 Exercise and Template Coaching
- Jump into the template
- Take time on it - dig deep  and understand how much time you as the team have to apply to sales, marketing, &c.
- Goal of the program is to grow revenue -> it's a byproduct of the time you've spent on the customer acquisition strategy
- Have to have the governor in place - here are the resources that we have
- How much time do we have to apply to market-based activities?
- Have to make getting to revenue a priority
	- Easy to put it on the back burner as other things come up
- Will often see that what someone was hired for and what they are actually doing are quite different
- Be honest about the skills, strengths, and weaknesses
- This is meant to be a starting point - it's OK if you are not spending a lot of time on market activities. That might need to change, but get the truth out first
- Before making any changes: is that number of market development hours enough? If not, how can we add more hours?
- More hours doesn't necessarily mean more revevnue
- Doing a resource review and talent roadmap every few months (beginning) or every year or so (more mature company) is a great idea
