## Summary

## Abstract
```

```

## Notes
- [[Triassic]] fossils from red beds
- What patterns do we see?
- In [[Canada]], focused mostly on [[Alberta]] [[Cretaceous]] fossils
- Paleontological consultant - looks over the fossils in a development
	- In [[Calgary]], ends up looking at mostly [[Paleocene]] 
	- Similarities to the [[Triassic]]
- Compare / Contrast the two different periods:
	- In the [[Triassic]] - ~230 Ma
	- In the [[Paleocene]] - ~60 Ma

### Triassic
- [[Pangaea]]
- At the time, [[Brazil]] was part of the interior of the continent
- Climate got very hot (espec. in the interior, away from the sea)
- More moisture near the poles (and the sea)
- Challenge in [[Brazil]] - today all of that is covered in trees!
- Few outcrops of rocks
- Sometimes when e.g. a farmer is clearing land they expose the rock
- Clear depositional layers
- Stratigraphic columns
	- Narrower the bar, the finer the sediment
- Increase the moisture towards the top
- Finer sediment -> slower moving (or flood plains)
- Large grains -> larger sediment
- Intervals of more moisture 
- [[Calcrete]] / [[Caliche]] deposits
- See burrows in the paleosols
	- Indicates that there are some ponds!
- [[Conchostracans]] - a kind of [[Crustacean]]
	- Amost mutually exclusive with fish
	- ponds were around long enough for the [[Conchostracans]], but not long enough for fish to live there
- Outcrop with [[Cynodontia|cynodonts]]
	- Same site has a [[Guaibasaurus]]
		- Kind of [[Sauropodomorph]]
- [[Riograndia guaibensis]]
- Red sediments - oxidation of iron
	- very typical of [[Triassic]] [[Brazil|Brazilian]] sediments
- Taphonomy - "burial laws"
- Diagenesis - "across generations"
	- Changes the sediments go through during lithification
- Sand -> Stone
- The parts  that get preserved are the sturdy bits
- Wet seasons
	- [[Calcite]] deposits
	- [[Silica]] ([[Quartz]]) dissolves
- Dry season
	- [[Calcite]] dissolves
	- [[Silica]] deposited
- Different things are deposited on the bones in diffrent seasons
- Grow crystals with [[Borate]]
- Crystals grow in the bone
	- [[Calcite]] expands in the bone; [[Quartz]] doesn't
	- [[Calcite]] distorts the shape
	- [[Quartz]] keeps the shape
- [[Dicynodonts]]
- [[Rhynchosaur]]

### Paleocene
- Slightly different, but more recognizable continents
- SA and NA not yet joined
- Slightly cooler
- More moisture
- [[Calgary]] - [[Paleocene]] [[Porcupine Hills Formation]]
	- Very little coal -> drier environment
- Stratigraphic columns
- Same sort of seasonality as in the [[Triassic]]
- pattern of lenses of [[Caliche]] deposits
- Some large leaf deposits
- e.g. small [[Mammalia]] jaws

### Takeaway
- Importance of taphonomy - what happens during the process of fossilization?
- Look at rocks - what can the different layers tell you?
- Combination of clues on rocks and fossils combined
- Future possibilities - what can we learn about the diagenetic patterns of [[Paleocene]] fossils?
