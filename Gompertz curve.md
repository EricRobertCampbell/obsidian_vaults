- [Wikipedia - Gompertz Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function)
- Related to the usual sigmoid / logistic, but the initial curve happens faster than the later one
- Equation is
$$
f(t) = ae^{-be^{-ct}}
$$
where 
	- 0 is the left asymptote, and $a$ is the right asymptote
	- $b$ translates the graph left or right
	- $c$ sets the growth scaling
- Comes from the [[Gompertz law of mortality]], which states that the rate of absolute mortality falls exponentially with current population size
