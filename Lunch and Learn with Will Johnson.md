## Summary

## Abstract
```

```

## Notes
- Public NPM modules are available
- Can have multiple actions on the same actions
- Each one can have its own runtime (helps with Node versioning)
- Node 18: able to use fetch natively in the actions!
- Rules and hooks are going to be deprecated at some point?
