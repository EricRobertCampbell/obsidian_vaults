## Notes
- Lots of early collecting in [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] was improperly documented
- As a result, lots of early quarries are lost - we don't know their location
- "Lost Quarry" - one that produced a significant fossil and whose existed is documented, bu whose location is unknown
- "Mystery Quarry" - Old quarry site that has been rediscovered, but whose identity remains unknown
- Collectors started marking locations of quarries with 'quarry stakes' - metal markers or whatnot set into concrete holes
- Some sites were never marked at all
- Although maps were issued (of the quarry locations), these often proved to be incomplete
- Today staking is almost always done
	- Even with the advent of GPS - sometimes it's not acurate enough to distinguish between close sites
- However, as GPS accuracy increases, the need to physically stake sites may be drawing to a close
- Because the people working the site often left garbage, it can be possible to identify mystery quarries from long ago
	- e.g. Finding a newspaper gives the date, archival photos can then be cross-referenced,  &c.
- Also, erosion is fast in [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] - as much as 1cm per year -> can obscure old quarries or stakes
- Archival photos including the skyline are the best
- Minor details in photos can be useful
- Stands of vegetation are relatively rare - can be used to help identify sites
- Old field notes
- Newspaper
	- Even if the date is missing, by looking at the stories and advertisements you can often find the newspaper itself, and thus the date
	- Can survive for a long time - oldest one is from 1914
- Glass bottle types can be linked to specific times

- Important work - finding lost quarries is important, and by giving the information back to the institutions, better information can be accumulated and gathered.
