## 1 Summary
To characterize the level of inference when looking at soft tissues in fossil taxa, look at the first two outgroups with living members and see whether they have the feature associated with the soft-tissue features.
## 2 Abstract
```
Fossils usually provide paleontologists with little more than bones and teeth as primary data. Because the broad aim of functional morphological analyses of extinct organisms is to breathe life into fossils, paleontologists are challenged to reconstruct those portions of the animal not normally prese~edin the fossil record - in particular, soft tissues. Soft-tissue considerations are important for two major reasons: (1)Soft tissues often havekorphogenetic over skeletaltissues, and (.2), such considerations often lie at the base of numerous paleobiological inferences. Furthermore, soft-tissue analysis can provide causal hypotheses of phylogenetic character correlation. A methodology for reconstructing soft anatomy in fossils - the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket approach - is proposed here. This method makes explicit reference to at least the first two extant outgroups of the fossil taxon of interest. It is based firmly on the relation of biological homology, provides a means of rigorously establishing the limits of our inferences, and allows construction of a hierarchy of inference. The approach can be applied to virtually any unpresemed trait of a fossil taxon with little or no modification.

## 3 Notes

- We often care about the soft tissues of extinct creatures
	- Bones come from soft tissue, not the other way around
	- Most of the inferences we make about e.g. behaviour come more form the soft tissue than the hard
- [[Extant Phylogenetic Bracket]] allows us to make inferences about the probability of a soft tissue feature being present based on (at least) the first two extant outgroups of the creature in question: the bracket
- Not a way to know for sure, but instead a way to characterize the level of inference required when trying to determine whether a feature was present
- 3 main reasons that soft tissues are important
	1. Morphogenic primacy of soft tissues: bones come from soft tissues, not the other way around. Bones are also responsive to the presence of soft tissues around them (e.g. remove certain muscles and certain bone features fail to develop)
	2. Judgement about soft tissues are at the heart of many inferences about e.g. behaviour: Chain of inference going from the hard tissues $\to$ soft $\to$ functional morphology $\to$ behaviours and moes of life, &c. Forms an inverted pyramid, where errors at the bottom reverberate up the chain.

	3. Soft tissues provide testable hypotheses of dependence or independence of phylogenetic features. Fundamental to a parsimony analysis is that the features are independent; otherwise changes in many features (correlated) would count as many changes, potentially overwhelming actually independent ones. Understanding of soft tissue could help to highlight features which are actually related. The hypotheses could be falsified by detailed analysis showing the features are not actually related or something.
- Basic idea is in 3 steps:
	1. Determine the causal association between soft tissues and their [[Osteological Correlates]]
	2. Formulate a hypothesis that similaristies among the extant taxa are due to inheritance from a common ancestor
	3. Test the hypothesis by surveying the fossil taxa for the [[Osteological Correlates]]
- Character assessment of the fossil taxon and its first extant outgroup is important to determine the character of the common ancestor
- Second, more distantly related extant taxon is the outgroup of the other two, allowing estimation of the ancestral feature at the [[Outgroup Node]].
- Most recent common ancestor of the [[Extant Phylogenetic Bracket]] is termed the [[Bracket Ancestor]]

- Since there may be more than one fossil taxon in the same bracket, we can test they hypothesis by seeing whether they also have the [[Osteological Correlates]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230928191805.png]]
  - Three levels of inference:
	  1. Level I: Both brackets have the soft tissues - positive and equivocal
	  2. Level II: One bracket has it but the other does not - Unequivocal (some speculation)
	  3. Level III: Neither bracket has it - negative and equivocal
- Note that none of these are definite - they just characterize the amount of speculation required to infer a trait in the fossil taxon
- [[Lagerstatte]] can sometimes stand as the 'extant' part of the bracket since the preservation can be so good
- Also has level I', II', and III' for features which have no [[Osteological Correlates]] (e.g. behaviour or meaty crests). For these, the test of the hypothesis is really phylogeny - whether the other living taxa have them.
		

## 4 Next Steps / Ideas
- Not entirely sure about the independence of traits that he was referring to - more research required
- Could we put some numbers on these hypotheses by 'bracketing' extant groups and seeing what the [[Extant Phylogenetic Bracket]] says about the traits they should / should not have? That would be really neat. Maybe also taking into account time from divergence?
