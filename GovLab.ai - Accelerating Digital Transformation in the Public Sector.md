```

- Through [[Data For Good YYC]]
- [[GovLab.ai]] - powered by [[AltaML]]
- 8 AI use cases
- They take internships
- Pipeline seems to be working - lots of successful projects
- [[GovLab.ai]] - internships happen every 4 months, but you need some skills
- [[Applied AI Lab]] (through [[AltaML]] is open to anyone
- They're doing a Flood Prediction model! Check the [[GovLab.ai]] website
- Product team and commercialization team are involved from the beginning
- Where should you put a new school?
	- What size should the school be?
- Building permit applications - is it complete and ready to the processed

## Education Capital Planning
- Optimizing school utilization rates
- Enter the school location, programs, grades, &c. -> predict the number who would enrol
- See the impact on that school, impact on schools around it, &c.
- Ethical AI: how do you ensure that the data you're using doesn't leave? This involves children's data - very sensitive
	- How do you ensure that certain groups aren't disadvantaged?
 
## Predicting Wildfire Occurrence
- Prediction by area

## Mountain Pine Beetle Detection
- Tree-specific
- Upload images for an area and outputs the likelihood that there are infected trees in the area / image

## Enhancing Contruction Permit Intakes
- Pre-screen the application and see whether it is complete
- Reduce time to rejection
- Runs on different rules - needs a signature, needs a stamp, &c.
- Evaluates the result for each rule
- For internal use
- In the pilot phase

## Questions and Discussion
- Focuses just on ML solutions
- There a digital transformation group in the Alberta government
- Generally there will be 2 ML people, some business consultants, and a support team (~6 people)
- Are there opportunities on the product side?
	- Yes - under the business solutions consultant role
	- Great way to see a lot of use cases if you have an interest in products
- What skills are most important, other than technical skills
	- Minimum of technical skills are definitely required
	- Communication skills - communicate technical ideas to a client
	- Collaborative coding
	- Understanding products, dashboarding, visualizations
	- Public speaking
	- Knowing how to work in an agile project (2 week sprints)
		- Small tasks, check in frequently, communicate blockers, &c.
- Extent of AI / ML - is there clear evidence that you couldn't otherwise do
	- Helpful wih scaling
	- More efficient in a workflow
- School optimization - presuming it was trained on historical data with demographics, can you incorporate things like gentrification, mobility, &c.
	- Still early days on a complex problem
	- Just one piece to provide information
	- Doesn't incorporate all cases - doing it step by step
	- Recognizing what you can and can't predict is important
- Development process: are you moving to a more DevOps development style
	- Always evolving
