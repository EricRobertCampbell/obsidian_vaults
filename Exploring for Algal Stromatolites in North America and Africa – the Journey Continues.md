# Exploring for Algal Stromatolites in North America and Africa – the Journey Continues

## Summary

## Abstract
```
This presentation is based on my exploring for algal stromatolites in North America and Africa. Accordingly, this can be described as a personal “journey” which hopefully will continue for another decade or two. The presentation begins with a brief overview of the occurrences of stromatolites over time – from the Precambrian to present day. The overview will be mainly about stromatolites which grew in marine environments but also to be discussed will be stromatolites which flourished in nonmarine lacustrine environments. Included also is a short review of the world-renown stromatolites which continue to thrive in Sharks Bay, western Australia.

The presentation will then provide detail on the five locations where I have been fortunate to view stromatolites in outcrop.
1.) Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories. A half century ago, in the summer of 1971 while involved in a mining exploration program, I discovered stromatolites on an island in the East Arm of Great Slave Lake near Fort Reliance. These stromatolites occurred in unmetamorphosed limestones dated as 1.8 billion years age which is Precambrian-Middle Proterozoic in age. This led to my abiding interest in stromatolites.
2.) Angola, West Africa. My next discovery of stromatolites was in 2005 in southern Angola where the stromatolites occur in Precambrian-Upper Proterozoic limestones age dated at 1.1 billion years old. These occur in the Lubango Plateau just west of the city of Lubango. The stromatolites have been little studied due to logistical challenges and the impact of Angola’s long civil war from 1975 to 2002. An exposure of Upper Cretaceous thrombolites discovered in 2014 along the coast of Angola will also be shown. Thrombolites are similar to stromatolites since they are microbial accretionary structures which were formed in shallow water by cyanobacteria and have a non-laminated clotted internal fabric.
3.) Gatineau, Quebec. In 2018, I learned in the literature about well-exposed Ordovician-age stromatolites located across the river from Ottawa in Gatineau, Quebec. This led to my travelling there to find those stromatolites. The Gatineau stromatolites have been described in the literature as “one of the best-known displays of stromatolites in Canada and certainly in an urban area”.
4.) Helen Lake, Banff National Park. In 2020 I had the opportunity to hike up into the alpine to Helen Lake and view some splendidly exposed Middle Cambrian stromatolites. The stromatolites cover an area of about 800 meters in length by 10 meters in width. These have been age dated at 510 million years of age. Despite their age and the impact of alpine weathering, these stromatolites are breathtakingly well preserved. Their elliptical shape reflects the dominant tidal currents at the time of deposition in the shallow Middle Cambrian sea.
5.) Waterton National Park. In 2022, I visited beautifully exposed Precambrian stromatolites in Red Rock Canyon in Waterton Provincial Park. These stromatolites are found in the Siyeh Formation and are dated as 1.3 billion years old.

I will also provide my “bucket list” of locations of stromatolites which I still hope to visit which include the thrombolites of Cambrian age at Flowers Cover, Newfoundland as highlighted by Wayne Laturnas’ photograph in the January, 2019 CSPG calendar. I also hope to see the 2.0 billion years old stromatolites in the Belcher Islands, a remote archipelago in the southeast part of Hudson’s Bay.

## Notes
- [[Shark Bay]], [[Australia]]
- Only a few living examples, mostly in marginal environments
- Why? Probably because there are too many predators eating the sheets
- [[Thrombolite]] - clotted vs. accretionary structures
- Nice ones: Helen Lake, Banff National Park
- "Go Take a Hike" - book with hiking and geology
- "Rocks, Rivers, and Ridges - geological .... of ...."
- "The Scenic Geology of Alberta" - Leckie
