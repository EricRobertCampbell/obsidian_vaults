## Notes
- 
### How to Think
- Approaching problems differently
- Book: "Questions are the Answer"
- Ask the questions that get you to the answer
- What kind of problem are you trying to solve?
- ![[Pasted image 20230323194419.png]]
- Clear:
	- Basically just follow instructions
- Complicated:
	- Need some domain knowledge to solve
- Complex:
	- Where things get interesting
	- No real prior expertise / recipe
	- "Unknown Unknowns"
- Chaotic
	- Emergency
	- Have to act immediately
	- E.g. your house is on fire - you just get out, *then* figure out what to do
- Another good book: "Thinking, Fast and Slow"
	- Anchoring - your initial thought "anchors" your thinking (constrains)
	- Substitution: replacing a hard problem with an easier one you can solve
	- Overconfidence
- "The Signal and the Noise" - Nate Silver
	- Foxes (generalists) and Hedgehogs (specialists)
	- Updating of belief
- "Super Forecasting" - Philip E. Tetlock & Dan Gardner
	- Fermi style thinking
		- Breaking problems down into smaller chunks to get an estimate
- "Poor Charlie's Almanack" - Charles Munger
	- Multiple mental models

### Storytelling
1. Know your audience
	- ![[Pasted image 20230323195935.png]]
2. Technique
	- "TED Talks"
		- True storytelling
	- Data dump
	- American / European storytelling
		- American: more "get to the point", what's the proble, what's the solution
		- European: more background, more context - more of a buildup before getting to the point
3. Authenticity and transparency
	- People can tell
4. Confidence
	- You're better than you think
	- Be willing to admit that you don't know something
	- Answer a question with a question
		- Can you help me understand the context?
5. Paint a picture - visualize the data

- Communicating your plan
	- "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" - Richard Rumelt
		- Strategy is story telling
		- 3 primary elements:
			- Really good definintion of the problem
			- General policy for tackling the problem - what's our hypothesis
			- Coherent set of actions to support the general policy - what are the specific steps we'll take

	- Robert Munch
		- Verbal storyteller
		- Tell the stories to kids
		- After he was done, kids would tell him funny stories
			- He would then make up stories about those
		- Make up a story, then gauge the audience's reaction
		- 40-50 attempts before he was comfortable making it a book
		- "There are no overnight successes"

### Q / A
- How to determine how much context?
	- European style: 10 minutes context
	- American: maybe 3 minutes
	- Do as much as is necessary, but no more
- What is the role of humour in getting the point across?
	- Contextual
	- Some will argue not to use humour at all
	- Depends on the subject matter: casualty report -> no humour, update on children's activities: more acceptable
- What is the best way to create and maintain interest?
	- Early hook
	- Have to meet the audience where they're interested
	- Empathy with the audience
- What are some common elements between American and European storytelling?
	- American - no real academic or theory
	- European - theory, mental model, &c.
- Book recommendations
	- He will share it with the organizer
- Data Dump - how to present relevant data but not overwhelm
	- Know the audience and their capacity
	- Politically savvy - who do you need to address the information to?
