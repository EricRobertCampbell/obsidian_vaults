# Chapter 3 - Soft Tissues

- Bones con record information about the soft tissue around them
- [[Extant Phylogenetic Bracket]] is used to help inform our understanding of soft tissues
- [[Osteological Correlates]] - features of the bone which correspond to soft tissues
	- E.g. [[Quill Knobs]], [[Trochanter]], &c.

## Dinosaur Muscles
- [[Myology]] - reconstruction and study of muscles

### Skull and jaws
- Rich in [[Osteological Correlates]]
- Three major groups:
	- [[Temporal Musculature]] stretches from the skull roof to the lower jaw
		- Some pass through the [[Lateral Temporal Fenestra]]; others pass over it laterally
		- Acted primarily to raise the lower jaw - [[Jaw Adductors]]
		- Countered by the [[Mandibular Depressors]] - closed the jaw
	- [[Palatal Muscles]] - Stretched between the numerous bones of the palate and the lower jaw
	- [[Orbitotemporal Muscles]] extended from the [[Braincase]] to the [[Palate]]
		- Filled much of the internal space of the orbital cavity and the [[Lateral Temporal Fenestra]]
		- [[Pterygoid Levator]] likely enabled portions of the [[Palate]] to move during feeding

### Neck
- Five major functions categories:
	1. Head dorsiflexors raise the head
		- Particularly large in species with large head, like [[Tyrannosauridae]] and [[Ceratopsia]]
		- Attachment sites on the occipital surface of the skull are particularly large
		- In [[Ceratopsia]], attach to the expanded [[Parietalsquamosal Shelf]]
		- In [[Tyrannosauridae]], attach to the expansive [[Nuchal Crest]]
	2. Head ventroflexion muscles lower the head
	3. Neck dorsiflexors raise the neck
	4. Neck ventroflexors lower the neck
	5. Neck lateroflexors move the nexk from side to side
- Assistance in raising the neck an dhead is provided by the [[Nuchal Ligament]], which runs across the tip of the cervical neural spines

### Thorax
- Least studied group of muscles
- Two main categories:
	- Epaxial muscles: extend along the back and upper part of the chest
	- Hypaxial muscles: Lower part of the chest and belly

### Pectoral girdle and forelimb
- Generally divided into 
	- **adductors**, which bring the limb towards the body
	- **abductors**, which extend the limb away from the body
- Main forelimb abductor is the [[Deltoid Muscle]], a large,triagular muscle that extends from the [[Deltopectoral Crest]] of the [[Humerus]] to the lateral surface of the [[Scapula]]
- Flexion of the forearm relative to the [[Humerus]] is powered by the [[Bicep Muscle]], which runs along the inside surface of the arm from the [[Humerus]] to the [[Radius]] and [[Ulna]]
- Adduction of the arm happens via the [[Pectoralis Muscle]], dese mass of chest muscles which  stretches from the [[Deltopectoral Crest]] to the [[Sternum]]
	- Particularly large in [[Aves|birds]], as it provides the main thrust for the flight stroke
- Arm itself straightens due to the [[Tricep Muscle]], which extends from the [[Humerus]] to the [[Olecranon Process]] on the [[Ulna]]
- [[Supracoracoideus]] was likely small in [[Dinosauria]], but in living [[Aves|birds]] is a large muscle under the pectoralis and which fans across the [[Sternum]]
	- Primary arm abductor in [[Aves|birds]]
	- Weird, because normally a muscle in that position contracting would bring the limb toward the body
	- Large [[Tendon]] extends from the [[Supracoracoideus]] through a bony canal between several bones of the [[Pectoral Girdle]] and attaches to the head of the [[Humerus]], causing an extension of the arm

### Pelvic girdle and hindlimb
- Usually the largest in the body
- Leave large and visible muscles scars $\to$ much better studied than many of the other muscle types
- Principal femoral protractors (bring the leg forward) and abductors (swing the leg outward) originate from the preacetabular blade of the [[Ilium]]
	- Extend to the anterior and lateral surfaces of the proximal femus and attach to the [[Lesser Trochanter]] and surrounding regions
- Muscles controlling femoral adduction (moving the limb toward the midline of the body) are some of the smaller muscles of the pelvic region and span from the [[Ischium]] to the posterior and medial surfaces of the [[Femur|femoral shaft]]
- [[Femur|femoral]] retractors, which pull the leg backward, originate along the tail, pass through the broad and smooth [[Brevis Fossa]] on the ventral surface of the potacetabular [[Ilium]], and attach to the flange-like [[Fourth Trochanter]] on the posterior of the [[Femur]]
	- These muscles are reduced in [[Aves|birds]] (they lost their tails). Instead, hindlimb retraction is usually powered by other muscles associated with knee flexion, because the [[Tibia]], not the [[Femur]], is the most prominent bone in their hindlimb
- The [[Ambiens]] extends from the rugose [[Ambiens Process]] on the anterior surface of the [[Pubis]] and attaches to the expansive [[Cnemial Crest]] on the anterior surface of the [[Tibia]]
- The [[Iliofibularis]] stretches from the lateral surface of the [[Ilium]] to a bulbous [[Tubercules|tubercule]] on the [[Fibula]]

## Dinosaur Skin
- Footprints are a common place to find [[Skin]] impressions
- Sometimes the [[Skin]] itself is mineralized
- Patterning is varied but generally conforms to that of modern [[Reptilia]]

## Dinosaur Feathers
- [[Feathers]] have been discovered with most [[Dinosauria]] groups
- First one discovered with feathers: [[Sinosauropteryx]] from the [[Jehol Group]], sequence of early [[Cretaceous]] rocks in [[Liaoning]], [[China]]
- Typical [[Feathers]] is composed of:
	- a hollow [[Calamus]] at the base (usually attached to skin or bone)
	- a central [[Rachis]]
	- Small barbs that project from the [[Rachis]] to form the [[Vanes]]
- Basically every [[Theropoda]] recovered from the [[Jehol Group]], as well as the [[Daohugou]] and [[Yanliao]] faunas, has feathers - it's likely that most members of this group were feathered
	- Most primitive unequivocal feathered ones are the [[Coelosaurs]] [[Sinosauropteryx]], a [[Compsognathid]], and [[Dilong]], a [[Tyrannosauridae]]. 
	- Simple; composed mostly of simple filaments
	- Some close [[Aves|bird]] relatives, like the [[Oviraptorosauridae]], [[Dromaeosauridae]], and [[Troodontids]] have pennaceous [[Feathers|feathers]] that are differentiated into a central [[Rachis]] and [[Vanes]] composed of barbs
- [[Feathers]] seem to have evolved pretty early on
	- [[Psittacosaurus]], an [[Ornithiscia|ornithiscian]], seems to have had hollow, feather-like filaments
	- They might even predate [[Dinosauria]] - [[Pterosaurs]] have also been discovered with feather-like filaments, which would push [[Feathers]] all the way back to the [[Avemetatarsalia]]
- Most of these couldn't fly - what purpose were the [[Feathers]] serving?
	- Display and thermoregulation
- Colours can be inferred using [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]] (SEM) to find [[Melanosomes]]
	- Structures in the feathers which contain [[Melanin]]
	- Ones with different shapes / arrangements contain different kinds of [[Melanin]]
	- Supports the display hypothesis
	- Also indicatd thatthey were true feathers, not just a result of taphonomic processes

## Air Sacs

### Postcranial Air Sacs

- [[Aves|Birds]] possess the same kind of vertebral [[Laminae]] and [[Fossa|fossae]] as [[Dinosauria]], and they use them to aid in their breathing style
	- "Flow-through" lungs
	- Air passes through the lungs in only one direction (posterior to anterior) - different from the tidal cycle used in mammals
- Steps:
	1. Inhale:
		1. some air goes through the lungs and then into the anterior [[Air Sacs]] before leaving the body during exhalation
		2. Remainder from from the [[Trachea]] into the posterior [[Air Sacs]]
	2. Exhale:
		1. Air in the posterior [[Air Sacs]] flows through the lungs and out the [[Trachea]], along with the air in the anterior [[Air Sacs]]
- Since only oxygen-rich air flows through the lungs, this system is very efficient
- [[Air Sacs]] are like balloons - soft, thin-walled structures that inflate and deflate during the process
- Often small, finger-like projections of the air sacs invade nearby bone or other internal cavities
- Reasons for this pneumatization are poorly understood
	- Ones in the bone to not participate in the respiratory cycle
	- May be to help lighten the skeleton?
- Telltale signatures ([[Osteological Correlates]]):
	- [[Foramen|foramina]] on the bone surface where the [[Air Sacs]] entered the bone
	- Internal chamber within the bone
	- [[Fossa|fossae]] and [[Laminae]] on the external surace where the [[Air Sacs]] nestled against the [[Bone]]
- presence of these [[Osteological Correlates]] allows us to infer their presence in [[Dinosauria]]
- So far, only the [[Saurischia]] seem to have them
- Primitive [[Saurischia]], like [[Coelophysoids]] and [[Prosauropods]] have simple [[Pneumatic Fossae]] and [[Pneumatic Foramina]] that are usually restricted to the anterior [[Cervical Vertebrae]]
	- Among living [[Aves|birds]], these are associated with the cervical [[Air Sacs]], which are the anterior [[Air Sacs]]
- More derived [[Theropoda]] and [[Sauropoda]] have more complex pneumatic features found across the skeleton
	- Foramina and fossae are larger
	- [[Laminae]] are more intricate
	- Present in the ribs, caudal vertebrae, pelvis, and shoulder girdle
	- In [[Aves|birds]] Foramina and fossae within the posterior dorsal vertevrae and pelvic girdle are associated with the thoracic [[Air Sacs]] (the posterior ones)
- Some implications:
	- They probably had flow-through lungs
	- Other features support this (in [[Saurischia]], but also in the non-pneumatic [[Ornithiscia]]):
		- [[Thorax]] is deep and robust
		- Thoracic vertebrae form a rigid olumn
		- Double-headed ribs are firmly joined to the [[Vertebrae]] to produce an incompressible [[Thorax]]
		- Gastral basked provides an accessory pumping mechanism for changing the volume of the abdominal cavity
	- These features provide precise control of the thoracic volume (hence that of the [[Air Sacs]]) as well as a strong [[Thorax]] to prevent lung collapse
- Several groups of [[Pterosaurs]] also had these features
	- Also found even further back among e.g. [[Erythosuchids]]
	- New discoveries indicate that living [[Crocodilia]] also have a form of unidirectional breathing (albeit without [[Air Sacs]])
	- Seems to indicate that some features that allow these have been evolving for a very long time

### Cranial Air Sacs

- Many bones in the [[Dinosauria]] [[Skull]] are hollowed by internal sinuses, which would have been filled by fleshy [[Air Sacs]] in life
- Extended from the nasal cavity and tympanic system around the ear
- Together comprise the [[Paranasal Sinus System]] and [[Paratympanic Sinus System]]
- Probably similar in structred to the postcranial [[Air Sacs]], but didn't take place in respiration
- Most prominent air sac associated with the [[Paranasal Sinus System]] was positioned next to the [[Antorbital Fenestra]]
- Possible that they played a role in thermoregulation or served to lighten the skull

## Lungs, Hearts, and Internal Organs

- Very rarely preserved, but in exceptional cases we can find traces

## Brain and Sense Organs

- Although they decay rapidly, they are protected by the bones of the [[Skull]] $\to$ we can use that to infer their shape
- E.g. by [[Computerized Tomography|CT]] scanning the [[Braincase]], we can get an idea of the sizes of the different lobes of the [[Dinosauria]] brain and hence get a general idea of what sort of information they were best at processing
- 12 major cranial nerves exited the brain laterally, anteriorly, and posteriorly
	- Shape and position can often be inferred by the presence of large stalks on the endocasts
- [[Semicircular Canal]] is also often preserved
- Comparison of brain size to body size can give a rough indication of intelligence
	- [[Encephalization Quotient]] quantifies whether a species has a larger or smaller brain than would be expected
	- General findings: the [[Encephalization Quotient]] became larger among the more derived [[Theropoda]], culminating with the relatively brainy [[Aves|birds]]
- Comparison of the [[Olfactory Bulb]] showed that many derived [[Theropoda]] (including the [[Tyrannosauridae]]) had a well-developed sense of smell
- Studies of living [[Aves]] and [[Reptilia]] indicate that the dimensions of the bony [[Cochlear Ducts]], whcih house the [[Basilar Papilla]] that controls hearing, correlates strongly with hearing sensitivity
	- [[Tyrannosauridae]] probably had a very keen sense of hearing
	- Same with [[Lambeosaurines]]
- Orientation and development of the [[Semicircular Canal]] of the inner ear gives insight into sense of balance, acuity of vision, and alert head posture
	- Living [[Amniota]] routinely orient their heads so that the lateral [[Semicircular Canal]], one of three interconnected tubes that link to the [[Cochlea]], is horizontal
	- We can use this to infer that
		- Most [[Theropoda]] held their heads at a slightly downturned angle
		- Many [[Sauropoda]] held their heads at a steeper fownward angle
	- Can also infer acuity of vision since the mucles that control visual focus are controlled by the [[Semicircular Canal]]
		- Little study, but it seems that [[Tyrannosauridae]] had quite elongate [[Semicircular Canal]] - maybe they also had acute vision?
	- Additional information on visual acuity is provided by the shape of the [[Skull]] and the [[Sclerotic Rings]], bits of bone within the eye which helped to support the eyeball
		- [[Theropoda]] had binocular vision, getting more and more binocular (better field of vision) as you get more and more derived
		- Some other studies have showed that [[Dinosauria]] [[Sclerotic Rings]] sizes match well with e.g. diurnal vs. noctural birds, which may be a idication of which species were diurnal or nocturnal.

## Microscopic Soft Tissues

- Recent findings of microscopic soft tissues (e.g. blood vessels, red blood cells, bone cells, proteins)
- Still controversial
