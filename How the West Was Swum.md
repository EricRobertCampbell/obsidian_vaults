# How the West Was Swum: The Marine Reptiles of Western Canada's Cretaceous Seas

## Summary
[Talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VIjiCyf8BY)
Overview of the main marine reptiles ([[Ichthyosaurs]], [[Plesiosaurs]], and [[Mosasaurs]]) found in western North America (specifically Alberta) during the [[Mesozoic]].

## Notes
- Marine reptiles are not dinosaurs - different branch (although some are related to living lizards, &c.)
- Two categories of marine vertebrates:
	- Primarily aquatic: fishes and sharks (today's live in the water and all of their descendants are too) - the entire evolutionary history in the water
	- Secondarily aquatic
		- ~375 Ma ago - some fish developed adaptions to go on land - [[tetrapods]].
		- aquatic organisms descended from tetrapods thatwent *back* to an aquatic lifestyle
  - Talk will focus on three of the groups of marine reptiles
	  - [[Ichthyosaurs]]
	  - [[Plesiosaurs]]
	  - [[Mosasaurs]]
   - [[Paleobiology Database|PBDB]] map of marine reptile localities:
   - ![[Pasted image 20230217120037.png]]
   - Most from the [[Cretaceous|cretaceous]]
   - During the [[Cretaceous|cretaceous]], the water level was higher than now - [[Western Interior Seaway]] split North America into two ([[Laramidia]] and [[Appalachia]])
   ## Triassic Ichthyosaurs
   - During the [[Triassic]], most of the continents were all together - [[Pangaea]].
   - [[Shonisaurus sikanniensis]] - giant ichtyosaur on display at the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum]]
	   - Largest marine reptile so far found
	   - ~210 Ma old
	   - ~21m long
	   - Collection was led by [[Betsy Nicholls]]
	   - ![[Pasted image 20230217120705.png]]
	   - Probably ate small fish and squid (maybe by suction)
## Jurassic
- Continent is starting to split
- Small interior seaway ([[Sundance Sea]]) in western North America
	- Outlet in Canada (basicall where the Rocky Mountains are today, so evidence is sparse)
## Cretaceous Plesiosaurs
- For most of it, cut in half by the [[Western Interior Seaway]]
- Exact extent changed dramatically over the [[Cretaceous]]
- Some different groups of plesiosaurs, but by the end there were basically two left:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230217121246.png]]
	- [[Polycotylids]]
		 - Relatively larger skulls and shorter necks
		 - Pobably more active predators
	- [[Elasmosaurids]]
		 - Smaller skulls at the end of a long neck
		 - Probably more ambush style predators
	 - [[Nichollssaura borealis]]
		  - ![[Pasted image 20230217121521.png]]
		  - [[Polycotylids|Polycotylid]]
		  - Found in a Syncrude mine by Fort McMurray
		  - Example of how industry and paleontology can work together
	- [[Albertonectes vanderveldei]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230217121822.png]]
		- [[Elasmosaurids|Elasmosaurid]] 
		- Found in Alberta
		- Largest number of neck vertebrae of any vertebrate (76)
		- 7m of the 12m length was neck
		- Unclear what the advantage was of having such a long neck
			- Maybe the ambush feeding style?
	- [[Terminonatator ponteixensis]]
		- Found in Saskatchewan
		- 'only' about 40 neck vertabrae, but otherwise similar to [[Albertonectes vanderveldei]]
		- Often found with [[gastroliths]] in their body:
			- ![[Pasted image 20230217122256.png]]
		- (In fact, lots of [[Elasmosaurids|elasmosaurs]] have these [[gastroliths]]) 
		- Hypotheses:
			- Used to help with digestion (in the crop) - grind up the food
				- Except: they mostly were eating small fish or squid - don't really need to be ground up
			- Help to control their buoyancy
				- Seems weird to spend that energy to move the rocks through the long neck
			- Maybe as a counterbalance
				- As the neck gets longer, they need more weight at the back - maybe the stones are backweighting the body to keep them more stable in the water column
	- Grasslands elasmosaur
		- Hiker found some vertebrae - much larger than [[Terminonatator ponteixensis]], but the samples were too incomplete to be able to directly compare
## Cretaceous Mosasaurs
- Three main genera:
	1. [[Prognathodon]]
	2. [[Mosasaurus]]
	3. [[Tylosaurus]]
 - [[Prognathodon]] and [[Mosasaurus]] were probably more closely related to each other than to [[Tylosaurus]]
 - More active predators feeding on larger prey than the [[Plesiosaurs]]
 - [[Tylosaurus]] has been known to eat very large prey items
	 - had very mobile hinges at the back of their jaw to enable larger gape
 - [[Tylosaurus]] are known from both Saskatchewan and Manitoba
 - [[Prognathodon overtoni]]
	 - ![[Pasted image 20230217123504.png]]
	 - Found in Alberta and Saskatchewan
	 - Note the colours - parts of it
	 - Came from a mine where they mine for [[Ammolite]]
	 - [[Ammonite]]s were a major food source for this mosasaur
	 - Same mine often produces marine reptiles
- [[Mosasaurus missouriensis]]
	- Best-known [[Mosasaurs|Mosasaur]] in western North America
	- Collected from Saskatchewan and Alberta
	- Also found through the mining of [[Ammolite]]
	- We have a bit of a growth series for the species
		- Skull: 72cm -> 100cm -> 110-120cm
		- Helpful - each fossil is a snapshot -> more of them gives us more information
## Questions
- At the [[Phillip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum]], they have a cast of a [[Tylosaurus]]; they also have a corn snake. What is the connection between them?
	- [[Mosasaurs]] look like Komodo dragons
	- Snakes are probably the closest living relative to [[Mosasaurs]]
- Have you heard of [[Pterosaur]] and [[Ammonite]] fossils as gut contents of [[Elasmosaurids|elasmosaurs]]
	- Not [[Ammonite|ammonites]] (haven't heard) - possible that they could have done some fishing at the surface of the water
	- Probably weren't able to bend their necks - quite rigid necks
 - Do you have any future research you don't mind sharing
	 - Lots!
	 - Looked at how different species of [[Mosasaurus]] are related to each other
	 - Only just started teaching, so don't have that much time to do own research
 - Favourite Californian marine reptiles?
	 - (Name I couldn't catch - some sort of [[Mosasaurs|mosasaur]])?
	 - 'Plotasaurus'?
- How many Californian marine reptiles?
	- Lots, but a bunch have been synonymized lately
- About [[Nichollssaura borealis]] - what is the age?
	- Older than the other specimens
	- From earlier in the [[Cretaceous]] - about 100 Ma?
 - [[Phillip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum]] has the gut contents of a [[Polycotylids|polycotilid]]
