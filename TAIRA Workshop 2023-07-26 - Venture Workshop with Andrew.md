- Overview of what's happened in the [[Venture Capital|VC]] markets in the last year? Where do you see things trending?
	- Reserve has raised interest rates -> makes it harder to attract VC dollars
	- Public markets in the US have bounced back
	- Lots of capital being put into new funds (Venture Capital)
	- Probably see a different style of investing
	- Enormous amounts of investing - pace has increased
		- Means that a few people will make lots of money, but most will lost
	- Next 2 - 3 years - probably be more of an attention on revenue (rather than pie-in-the-sky growth potential)
	- Reaction up and down the chain of capital - stronger emphasis on revenue, sustainability, &c.
	- Good news - lots of the graduates of the program are getting funded because of the emphasis on revenue
	- Bootstrapping to profitability is a better approach than relying entirely on venture capital
- Are you seeing this across the border (American and Canadian)?
	- Bias in terms of conservative venture
	- [[Venture Capital]] that favours a path to profitability
	- Insists on not just throwing spaghetti at the ceiling
	- Alberta founders have been more conservative
	- More capital and more experiences funds in [[Alberta]]
	- Firms in the states seem to be following the lead of [[Alberta]]
	- He's positive about the [[Venture Capital]] in [[Alberta]]
	- Be wary about an overinvestment - do you know what to do with the money?
		- Huge difference between needing money to stay in business and needing money because you have things figured out but need money to grow
	- If you're pre market fit what's in your data room? Probably not a lot!
	- Things in the [[Venture Capital]] generally run in about 10-year cycles
		- The [[Venture Capital]] has 5 years to invest and then in the next 5 years can only invest in the ones they've already invested in
- As you're investing in the later half of the 5 years, as an investor, are you making bets you think will turn around in less than 5 years?
	- Yes
	- Point of [[Module 9 - Raising Venture Capital]] was to get more comfortable with the process
	- Good question - the fund you're considering investing me in, what's the horizon for that? Any [[Venture Capital]] should answer that honestly, and will give you an insight into their motivations
	- Where are they in the life cycle of the fund?
	- Even asking the question makes you sound thoughtful, like you understand the investor, want to help them with the goal, &c.
		- When you raise money, the [[Venture Capital]] is your customer - treat them with the same care as with any other customer
- What year is the [[GrowthX]] fund in?
	- Year 0
	- Probably only have time / money for one more company (not investing the normal way)
	- High interest rate actually helps this fund since there's such a focus on revenue
	- If you are with a [[Venture Capital]] that is early in the process, then you're basically marketing material
- How do rolling rounds affect that?
	- Typically raise a fund in multiple closes
	- Typically hold off as long as possible - the clock starts at the time of the first close
	- Also, you only have X months to raise the rest of the fund
	- Start of the [[Internal Rate of Return|IRR]] clock
	- [[Special Purpose Vehicle]] are becoming more common - only exist to invest in a single company
		- Kind of the opposite of a normal [[Venture Capital]] - start with the opportunity and then go raise that money from others
	- What's the advantage of that approach?
		- The person running it doesn't need to be a money manager
		- Lots of stuff that goes with that that they don't want to do
		- Avoided by the [[Special Purpose Vehicle|SPV]]
	- Need to be aligned with your investor (if they want to use an [[Special Purpose Vehicle|SPV]])
		- One disadvantage is that when you agree to this they then need to go get some money - there's a delay
- When you're getting into the early stages and have some interest, does presenting urgency on our end is that a positive or negative for the [[Venture Capital]]?
	- Need to find funders that are good fits for you
	- Part of that is the sense of urgency
	- Don't create a sense of false urgency
	- OK to communicate that you need some capital because you were focused on getting customers - e.g. you can't fulfill orders unless you have capital - that's a good problem to have!
	- You have a problem that money can solve!
	- That can create a specific timeline
	- Is the urgency internal or external?
	- That kind of urgency should be communicated
	- Typically you want to start the conversation with investors from a place of strength - 4-6 months of salary, &c. How does that affect the conversation?
		- Personal position: place of strength / weakness is a bit silly
		- Invite people to be the kind of person that you want them to be
		- There are definitely investors who would take advantage of that situation
			- Probably want to avoid them
		- The fact that you're in a time-pressure situation may reflect negatively on you - why are you in the situation? But not necessarily - it could be an external influence or something like that
		- Should be a conversation to see good fit
		- (Participant) often the questions are about trying to uncover the decision process. Being honest and seeing where you've learned from the experience is key
			- Andrew agrees - here are the mistakes I've made, here's what I learned, here's what we're going to do next, &c.
- What are the drivers that prompt you to suggest a follow-up investment?
	- Say what you're going to do and do what you said you'd do
		- They check!
		- Exponential growth of a company is a long-term thing - in the short term there'll be fluctuations. Hard to see if you're on the right track in the moment
		- [[Venture Capital]] is not expecting to see the exponential!
	- Are you continuing to communicate with investors throughout the journey? If not, they automatically do not get follow-up investment
		- Not only the positives! But be sure to communicate what you're doing to ameliorate this in the future
	- What is the team dynamic?
		- Can you attract and maintain top talent?
	- Are you doing the right things for your go-to-market?
		- Are you chasing the newest shiny products? E.g. chase a big investor if you just build a new feature, &c.
	- Downstream investors are really important
		- They know that they will not be the only investors
		- Capital risk - one of the 11 risks for [[Venture Capital]]
- Do you ever act as lead investors?
	- Yes
	- Lead investor - who's going to lean in and do the most diligence and write the documents and ...
	- Lots of legal documents to be signed on Series A (e.g.) - it's the lead investor that writes the documents and lots of people sign on
- Situation - just now talking to a US investors - US investor is pushing for a high evaluation (based on entry to the US market), others want a lower one. What to look out for?
	- All investors are working their own priorities - have to understand them
	- May be because they have a limit on how much ownership they can have -> need a higher valuation to write a bigger cheque
	- US investors typically need a higher rate to satisfy the investors
	- Stacked preferences - every time you do a round of investors, the later ones have stacked preferences (who gets what on payback)
		- Early investors may need a huge investment just to get anything back at all
	- Probably local investors are pitching reasonable valuations as a selling point - they may not be able to match the higher valuation
- How do we engage with you (Andrew)
	- Email at growthx (andrew@growthx) or something like that
- There's a template for the investors' update - this should start immediately
- Let [[GrowthX]] know about positive events!
- Even if they are not the perfect investors, they know lots of other venture funds -> can help in that way
