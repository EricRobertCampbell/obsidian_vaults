## Summary

## Abstract
```
Upper Cretaceous tyrannosauroid material from North America was primarily known from upper Campanian through Maastrichtian formations until the recent discovery of derived tyrannosaurid taxa from lower-to-mid Campanian deposits in the southwestern United States. However, diagnostic material from contemporaneous deposits further north in Alberta (Canada) and Montana (USA) has yet to be documented. Here we report the discovery of a new tyrannosaurine tyrannosaurid from the midCampanian Foremost Formation of Alberta, Thanatotheristes degrootorum gen. et. sp. nov, which helps fill this gap. The new tyrannosaurine, diagnosed by five autapomorphies, is found to be the sister taxon to the late Campanian genus Daspletosaurus. Thanatotheristes is distinct from Daspletosaurus based on several features, and lacks at least two apomorphies of the latter taxon. Together, these taxa form the newly established Daspletosaurini, a clade of long-, deep-snouted tyrannosaurines endemic to northern Laramidia during the Campanian. Our study demonstrates that Tyrannosauridae is composed of several geographically-segregated clades rather than a series of monogeneric successive sister taxa as recovered by previous studies. The geographic segregation of tyrannosaurid clades within North America provides renewed evidence for provinciality among large theropods during the Late Cretaceous.

## Notes
- Fossil record of Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Tyrannosauridae]] is restricted to the upper [[Campanian]] and [[Maastrichtian]], with only a few taxa from a slightly older stratum
- However, [[Tyrannosauridae]] should have originated between 90 and 80 Ma ago
- Long hidden evolutionary history for the clade!
- All studies recover [[Tyrannosauridae]] as being subdivided into the gracile [[Albertosaurinae]] and the robust [[Tyrannosaurinae]]
- However, some different ideas about the relationships among the [[Tyrannosaurinae]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230608170625.png]]
	- Each scenario has different implications for the dispersal and origination of the [[Tyrannosauridae]]
	- e.g. the first has [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] evolving from the Asian groups and migrating over, while the second has it evolving from the southern group of [[Laramidia|Laramidian]] [[Tyrannosaurinae]]
- Phylogenetic differences between the northern and southern groups of [[Tyrannosauroidea]]
- Mirroring the herbivores at the same time, seem to be some provinciality
- Paper is a description of a new species, [[Thanatotheristes degrootum]], from the mid-[[Campanian]] [[Foremost Formation]]
- Earliest diagnostic material of [[Tyrannosauridae]] material from [[Canada]]
- Sister group to (younger) [[Daspletosaurus]]

- [[Foremost Formation]] is the lowest stratigraphic unit of the [[Belly River Group]]
- (See [[@eberthGeology2005]])

- (Then there's a lot of very detailed anatomical description which makes me realize just how little anatomy I know)

- One of the few [[Dinosauria]] from the interval immediately preceding the very fossiliferous [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]
- About 2.5 Ma older than [[Gorgosaurus libratus]] and [[Daspletosaurus torosus]] from the [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]
- Oldest known northern species (about the same age as the more southern [[Dynamoterror dynastes]] from the [[Menefee Formation]] in southern [[New Mexico]])
	- Slightly younger than [[Lythronax argestes]] from the [[Wahweap Formation]] of southern [[Utah]]
- Basically solidifies three clades in the [[Tyrannosaurinae]] corresponding to different morphotypes:
	- [[Daspletosaurini]] - a group of long- and deep-snouted [[Tyrannosaurinae]] with a high maxillary tooth count
	- clade of short- and deep-snouted [[Tyrannosaurinae]] including [[Teratophoneus]], [[Lythronax]], and [[Dynamoterror]]
	- Clade of gigantic and extremely deep- and broad-snouted [[Tyrannosaurinae]] consisting of [[Tarbosaurus]], [[Tyrannosaurus]], and [[Zuchengtyrannus]]
- Along with the slender [[Albertosaurinae]] and the long- and shallow-snouted [[Alioramini]], there are 5 major lineages which evolved within [[Tyrannosaurinae]]
- Differences in morphology could be because of differences in prey composition or hunting / feeding strategies
- Latitudinal differences in which clades appear
- Also some evidence of [[Niche Partitioning]]
