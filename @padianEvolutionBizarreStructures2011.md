## Abstract
```
‘Bizarre structures’ in dinosaurs have four main traditional explanations: mechanical function, sexual selection, social selection and species recognition. Any of these can be plausible for individual species, but they fail to be persuasive when other lines of evidence cannot adequately test them. The first three also fail as general propositions when phylogenetic analyses based on other characters do not support scenarios of selective improvement of such functions in their clade (or the explanation simply does not apply to any other species in the clade). Moreover, the hypothesis of sexual selection requires significant sexual dimorphism, which has never been conclusively established in dinosaurs. We propose instead that species recognition may have been a more general force that drove the evolution of bizarre structures in dinosaurs. That is, the bizarre structures communicate to other individuals a variety of possible associational cues, including species identification, potential protection and social habits and the appropriateness of potential mates. In other words, bizarre structures amount to an advertisement for positive association. Neither species recognition nor any other hypothesis should be a ‘default’ explanation. Although direct observation is impossible, we propose two tests. First, contrary to adaptive, social or sexual selection, under the species recognition model morphology should be expected to evolve without obvious directional trends, because the only objective is to differ from one's relatives. Hence, patterns of evolution of bizarre structures should be relatively proliferative and non-directional. Second, several contemporaneous species should overlap in geographic range (sympatric, parapatric, peripatric). Fossil species often show evidence of this pattern in the past by ‘ghost ranges’ of related taxa. These tests together could reinforce or weaken an argument for species recognition.

## Notes
- 'Bizarre Structures' - features unusual enough to catch the eye of a paleontologist and invites an explanation beyond the usual
- Four traditional explanations
	- Mechanical Function
	- [[Sexual Selection]]
	- [[Social Selection]]
	- [[Species Recognition]]
- Purpose is more to suggest how these questions should be addressed, not necessarily to argue for a particular one
- Examples of these bizarre structures
	- Frills and horns of [[Ceratopsia]]
	- Domes of [[Pachycephalosaurs]]
	- Crests of [[Lambeosaurines|lambeosaurine]] [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurs]]
	- Scute complexes of [[Ankylosauria]]
	- Plates and spikes of [[Stegosauria]]
- Most explanations focus on mechanical function (it accomplishes some purpose) or [[Sexual Selection]]
- [[Sexual Selection]] has become something of a default if no other purpose can be discerned
- Apparently the hypothesis is rarely tested
- Most structures will fulfill more than one function - e.g. it can be useful and sexy
- Accepted approach to testing [[Homology]] of behaviours / structures is the [[Extant Phylogenetic Bracket]]
	- Doesn't help too much in our case - the brackets of [[Dinosauria]] are [[Aves]] and [[Crocodilia]], neither of which have these bizarre structures
- [[Analogy]] is what is left, and that is problematic
	- Quality of the [[Analogy]] depends on 
		- precision of deinition of the features that are compared
		- Separation of those features / functions from ancillary or irrelevant ones

### Classes of Explanation of Bizarre Structures
- Function and display
- Definitions:
	- *Mechanical Function*: something to do with locomotion, feeding, insulation, or communication
	- [[Sexual Selection]] - Advantage gained to access to mates when one sex possesses a feature and the other does not
		- Important: discrete structure, function, or behaviour
		- Present in one sex *and not the other*
		- **This seems like argument by definition** - can't the definition be a bit broader?
		- Also implies that e.g. sligh size differences don't count
	- [[Social Selection]] - Features that individuals in a species use to comprove their competitive advantage for resources
	- [[Species Recognition]] - features that allow others of the same species to recognize each other for various social purposes
	- [[Mate Recognition]] - not the same thing, but is a subset
 
- Apparently a challenge to most mechanical explanations is that the evolution of the features / functions in the clade are rarely considered -> no evidence that the function evolved at all, and so the explanation must be considered to be in doubt
- [[Phylogenetic Dissection of Adaptations]]
	- Can map the evolution of traits through lineages / clades
	- Adaptation to be assessed, necessary and ancillary components must be separated. Then the assembly of the required parts can be mapped on a phylogeny
	- Formalized:
		1. Identifiy the adaptation, the diagnostic (not just the associated) features, and the groups that possess it
		2. Phylogenetic analysis of the groups
		3. Identify the sequence in which the different parts were acquired
		4. Analyze the apparent rolesof diagnostic characters at each stge before the adaptation is assembled, using function, physical, ecological, genetic, and other lines of evidence
	- Explanations for the bizarre structures must explain the evolution of the features and their assembly
	- E.g. at each node, should be able to point to the assembled parts and assess their function with respect to the organism as a whole
		- **Doesn't this make the assumption that evolution is directional and that everything serves some purpose? Seems to leave out things that just kind of... hang out**
	- If there is no evidence for the improvement of function or the assembly of a new one, the adaptive hypothesis fails
	- "Therefore, functional explanations that are not tested phylogenetically have no demonstrated evolutionary basis and are of limited value"
		- **I am not convinced - couldn't the role change? E.g. some sort of sexual selection, then if becomes functional at some point?**
- Lots of challenges to mechanical explanations - pokes lots of holes in the different (e.g. defensive) explanations for these structures
- Apparently there's some research that indicates that structures used to e.g. ward off predators don't enjoy long-term success unless they're honest - that is, they can back up the threat.
- [[Sexual Selection]] could be shown if there were some directionality in the trends among clades
- Again leans on the idea that sexual selection requires that one sex has the feature and th other doesn't
	- Regardless, it's really hard to show sexual dimorphism in [[Dinosauria]], even if it's there
- Under the explanation of [[Species Recognition]], they would have no apparent mechanical function and would not specificall evolve to attract member of the opposite sex
	- Make it easier to recognize others of the same (or different) species
- Difficult to distinguish [[Species Recognition]], [[Social Selection]], and [[Mate Recognition]] - they are all intraspecific behaviours and difficult to observe
	- Also significant overlap
- Lots of problems establishing [[Sexual Dimorphism]] in [[Dinosauria]]
	- Goes through and shows that lots of evidence for this is underpowered
	- Also: generally generally just slight size differences, not new structures
- [[Mate Recognition Hypothesis]]
	- Requires a degress of sexual dimorphism that is not supported in [[Dinosauria]]
- [[Species Recognition]] doesn't require sexual dimorphism
	- **Kind of seems like the requirements are the same as for [[Sexual Selection]], but without the [[Sexual Dimorphism]]? **
	- Also accounts for bizarre structures in individuals not involved in mating
- Two tests:
	- Pattern of diversification should be essentially random (it's not being selected for / against - it just matters that there is something to recognize)
	- Evidence that closely related species occupied the same space at the same time (and so would require differentiation)
- Bizarre structures show no directional evolution in clades
- Apparently there are a few examples of closely related species living close in space and time
- [[Species Recognition Hypothesis]]
	- Seems to account for more things than the other explanations?
	- "Simpler and more general way to explain the evolution of bizarre structures in dinosaurs"
