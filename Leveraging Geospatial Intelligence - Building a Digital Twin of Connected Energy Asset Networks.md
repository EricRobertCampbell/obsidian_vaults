- [[Silvia Losada]]
- Think about data -> think about tables
- [[Geospatial]] -> good visualizations
- Can work in multiple dimensions
- Energy industry: no on is using the datasets (facilities, wells, pipelines)
- Can we fix this?
- Integrate the different datasets?
- [[AbaData Connectivity Project]] - creating a connected network for the Canadian energy industry
- Allows you to see the connections and downstream effects
- Predict e.g. failure
- Using public source datasets from the energy regulators
- e.g. Pipelines and wells - all of the data is public and open
- Wells and Facilities are points, but pipelines are lines... have to choose the geogetry (point, line, polygon - three fundamental geometries)
