## Summary

## Notes
- Lots of rocks, trees, and water
- 0.5% of the population, but 10% of the forested land and 20% of the freshwater resources
- 2nd largest country -> lots of rocks!
- Famous Canadian building stone:
	- [[Tyndall Stone]]
	- Tyndall limestone
	- From Tyndall, Manitoba
	- Contains fossils
1. Oldest rocks on Earth
	- Nuvvuagittuq, Quebec
	- 4.3 Billion years old (Earth is just 4.5 billion!)
 2. World's largest Glacial Erratic
	 - 'Big Rock' of Okotoks, Alberta
	 - Chunk of the [[Rocky Mountains]]
	 - ~16,500 tonnes
3. Some of the world's oldest animals: [[Burgess Shale]]
	- In Yoho National Park
	- Incredibly well preserved
	- [[Opabinia regalis|Opabinia]]
	- About 452 Ma
4. World's oldest multicellular life: Mistaken Point, Newfoundland
	- Captures the transition from unicellular to multicellular life
	- Near Cape Race Lighthouse
	- [[Mudstone]] and [[Volcanic ash]]
	- [[Ediacaran]] fauna?
5.  Largest visible impact crater: Manicouagan Region, Quebec
	- 70 km across
	- 4 impact craters are larger, but you can't see them
6.  Potash - Saskatchewan's Super mineral
	- Common name for [[Sylvite]]
	- Created when Saskatchewan was part of a very saline sea
	- Created a salt deposit of [[Sylvite]]
	- Rich in potassium
	- Saksatchewan is the largest exporter of potash
7.  World's Oldest Reptiles: Fossil Cliff at [[Joggins]], Nova Scotia
	- Covered in ripples, but some of the ripples are the footprints of early reptiles!
	- [[Carboniferous]] in age
	- Famous for [[Hylonomus lyelli]]
	- Fossils of trees preserved upright
	- Lizards would crawl into the stump and then die -> be preserved there
8. World-famous dinosaur fossils: [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]]
	- [[Cretaceous]] dinosaur site
	- >40 dinosaur species from there
	- Only other place comparable is the [[Gobi Dessert]]
9. The [[K-Pg Boundary]]: when (non-avian) dinosaurs went extinct
	- Southern Saskatchewan and Alberta
	- Most extensive exposures are in southern Saskatchewan
	- Can clearly see the boundary
10. Gold rush!: Klondike Goldfields, Yukon
	- Confluence of the Klondike and Yukon rivers (Dawson City)
	- Serpentine ridges are the mine tailings from [[Placer Mining]]
	- Gold rush: 1897 - 1899
11. [[Ammolite]]: Provincial gemstone of Alberta
	- Semi-precious
	- Fossilized [[Aragonite]] shells of [[Ammonite]]
	- [[Korite Ammolite Mine]] (near Lethbridge) is one of the only legal commercial  fossil companies in Canada
	- Mine to make jewellery
12. The World's Largest [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]  - Scotty, from Eastend, Saskatchewan
	- Paper came out in 2019 showed that Scotty was larger than Sue
- Questions:
	- Have you done fieldwork at Mistaken Point, and how does it differ from fieldwork in Saskatchewan?
		- yes - very different. At Mistaken Point you are looking at impressions. Also, you can't take the rocks, so you take molds instead. Different organisms - Mistaken point are about 500Ma, Saskatchewan is 72 - 66 Ma
	- How close do the dinosaurs found in Saskatchewan get to the [[K-Pg Boundary]]?
		- Below: Dinosaurs within 2m, and other fossils within 20cm
		- Mammal cm above it
	- Can you give some background about how the old rock from Quebec would have survived recycling from Plate Tectonics?
		- The central part of Canada is a [[Craton]] - never got close enough to the edge to get subducted
		- Has been terrestrial basically since it was formed
		- Parts of Australia are the same
		- Has to do with buoyancy of continental vs. oceanic crust
	- What is your favourite field site?
		- [[Grasslands Provincial Park]] in Southern Saskatchewan
