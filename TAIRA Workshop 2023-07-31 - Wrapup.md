## 1 Final Wrap-Up
- Remain in contact with the people there (Max and Jeannette) - they still want to hear about how things are going

- Remember to keep using the tools from the program - e.g. ICP sheets, resources to use when starting a new campaign, &c.
	- Don't drop the process!

### 1.1 Best Practices
- Regular pipeline reviews and market milestones
	- Who should you be targeting? Who should you be reaching out to? Should we launch a new campaign? &c.
	- Best time to get leads, &c. is when you're not desperate for them - do things early, while you still have options
- Have the discipline to see things through and develop mastery
	- Stick with things - don't pivot too quickly
	- Have the discipline *not* to do things
- Be persistent and practice lead sustainability
	- Continue to reach out to the [[Ideal Customer Profile|ICP]]s
- ** The Last thing you should change is the ICP **
	- Single change that doesn't work - pivot to sell to Americans
	- Generally not ready for it
- Don't bring feelings to the data fight
	- You should have the data to determine what is a good conversation / lead
	- Hold yourself, sales team, &c. accountable

### 1.2 Achieving Investor Readiness
- Sticking with the program
	- Attract investors without needing them
	- Build a traction narrative in time for the fundraise
	- Strong story = better terms, keep more equity, better funds, shorter fundraising cycles
- Deprioritizing revenue
	- Fundraise reactively instead of proactively
	- Lipstick on pig and weak narratives
	- Weaker story = more founder dilution, worse terms
