## 1 Abstract
> Imagine a healthcare landscape where the relentless hum of emergency rooms doesn't signal despair but efficiency, where healthcare practitioners are not just surviving but thriving, and where patients' hopes for timely treatment are not just met but exceeded. This isn't a distant dream but an attainable reality with the transformative power of data. Together, let's explore how we can turn data into our most powerful ally in the quest to not just heal but revolutionize healthcare. This talk walks you through the trials and triumphs of integrating data science into the very heartbeat of healthcare.

## 2 Notes

	- Possible mismatch - who is benefiting and who is paying?
- [[Gaussian Process]]
- Even the best solution needs distribution -> getting people to actually use it and know about it is key!
