## 1 Abstract
> How do we implement data changes within teams, projects, organizations? Is a top-down strategy more effective than bottom-up? Is success going to be determined by to resources? Time? Tools? Skills? Training? Just as important perhaps, what would be considered a data “success”?

> As agents of change, we need to be thinking about how different stakeholders “think” about data.

> In this presentation we will consider the context of how different components of organizations view, interact, and are influenced by data projects. As a framework we can leverage Change Management Theory, or the processes organizations launch to improve current performance, seize new opportunities, or address key issues. We’ll examine 4 established Change Management models from the world of business consultancy, each one focused on addressing the different impact responses to an organizational change stimulus, followed by a brief application of these concepts to a hypothetical scenario, and concluding with a selection of simple, yet powerful, techniques to help drive data engagement within our teams, departments, and organizations.

- [[GeologicAI]]
	- 70% of change projects fail (study in [[Harvard Business Review]] about 30 years ago) - *Reengineerging the corporations*
- Large number don't meet the expectations, but maybe aren't really failures
- Closer to 10% that are really failures
- Habits, routines, and norms
- [[Change Management Theory]]
	- Address the human side of changes - the people who are actually changing
- Couple of established models for change management
- Top-down v. bottom-up approaches - where do you start? Management or the actual employees?
- Make sure to use the existing style guide - familiarity can help with adoption, &c.
- Don't want the technical people to be out of the loop / decision process - need to account for the fact that real people are going to be the ones that are making decisions
