## Summary

## Abstract
```
The Pipestone Creek Bonebed, located just outside the small town of Wembley in northwestern Alberta, was discovered in 1973 by Al Lakusta, a local high school teacher. He had stumbled on one of densest dinosaur bonebeds in North America, with an average of 100-300 fossils per square metre and with an estimated size of three football fields. The rhinoceros-sized ceratopsian dinosaur that made up the bulk of the bonebed specimens was described as a new species, christened Pachyrhinosaurus lakusti. Subsequent paleontological interest in the region led to the discovery of other dinosaur bonebeds, several microvertebrate localities, dinosaur trackway sites, and hadrosaur specimens displaying soft-tissue preservation. In 2015, the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum opened in Wembley, with an aim to inspire and educate visitors about the Pipestone Creek Bonebed, and about Canada’s northwestern dinosaur communities. There are still many questions to explore in the Wapiti Formation. The formation is Late Cretaceous (80 – 68Ma) in age and stretches form northwestern Alberta to northeastern British Columbia. The formation is divided in five units, with Units 3 and 4 being the most fossiliferous. The dinosaur communities within these terrestrial units are significant because they fill the ‘Bearpaw Gap’, a time interval when southern Alberta was covered by the Western Interior Sea. Outside of two Pachyrhinosaurus bonebeds, the dinosaur faunas of the Wapiti Formation are dominated by the hadrosaurs Edmontosaurus and Lambeosaurus. Theropods and ankylosaurs are known from footprints and teeth, but their diversity remains largely unknown. The paleoflora that has been studied from the Wapiti Formation suggests a largely deciduous forest with little evergreen vegetation, which experienced strong seasonality associated with photoperiod. Given that these floras would have provided the dietary biases for dinosaur megaherbivores, it lends support to the theory that these animals were migratory. Understanding the seasonal nature of the Late Cretaceous boreal forests and floodplains through paleofloral analyses and isotope geochemistry may help to elucidate inferred behaviors such as herding and migration and may provide clues as to the environmental tolerances of some of Canada’s most northern dinosaur
communities.
