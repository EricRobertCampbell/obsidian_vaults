# The “Rasetti Stone” and the tree of life—A phylogenetic perch for the enigmatic Stenothecoida

**Authors**: [[Paul Johnston]]
**Series**: [[Alberta Paleontological Society Symposium]]
**tags**: #paleontology #talk 

## 1 Summary
Does a bunch of research - [[Stenothecoida]] ends up being a stem [[Brachiopoda]]

## 2 Abstract
```

```

## 3 Notes
- [[Stenothecoida]] - "problem child"
- [[Taxonomy]] - the oldest job
- A [[Phylogenetic Tree]] is a hypothesis about evolutionary relationships
- Darwin had one of the oldest ones
- [[Ernst Haeckel]] - "Tree of Life" (1866)
- Normally not too hard to classify
	- Sometimes we run into ones that are difficule
### 3.1 Burgess Shale
- In [[Yoho National Park]]
- [[Charles D. Walcott]], 1909
- In addition to the famous [[Shale|shale]] there, there are also [[Limestone|limestones]] (mostly ignored)
- The "Rasetti Stone" was a piece of limestone from there
	- Shells were silicaceous -> could dissolve them out using acid
	- Recovered a bunch of specimens
		- [[Echinodermata]], [[Mollusca]], [[Brachiopoda]]... and some thins that were harder to classify!
- They had asymmetric shells
	- V-shaped grooves
	- Parallel grooves lining the ... shell
	- Bivalved animals w/ one shell inflated more than the other
	- Not a clam - missing distinctive muscle scars, &c.
- [[Franco Rasetti]] found them first
	- Physicist
	- Mostly focused on [[Trilobites]]
	- Found them in the [[Mount Wapta Formation]]
	- 1901
	- Ph. D in 1922
	- Classmate of [[Enrico Fermi]]
	- left Italy due to the rise of fascism
	- Came to Canada at [[Laval University]]
	- Disliked cooption of physics for the military
	- Led him to rekindle an interest in zoology
	- Expert on [[Cambrian]] [[Trilobites]] - named over 3000!
- [[Franco Rasetti|Rasetti]] thought that they might be [[Mollusca]]?
- Followed [[Charles D. Walcott]]'s suggestion - thought that there might be only one shell, like a limpet
- Also found some in [[Utah]]
- Oldest - from [[China]] - early [[Cambrian]]
	- Latest are from the [[Burgess Shale]]
	- 25Ma history
- Seem to have a circumtropial distribution
- No symmetry
- [[Brachiopoda]] vs. [[Mollusca]] symmetry:
	- [[Brachiopoda]] - axis is down the middle of the shell (cuts each in half)
	- [[Mollusca]] - axis is *between* the two shells
- People had put them all over the place
- Hole at the apical end of the shell
- In articulaed shells
	- Like [[Brachiopoda]]
	- But on both sells (vs 1 in the [[Brachiopoda]])
- What is the weird triangular thing inside the shell?
	- "Apical boss"
- Opening occurred in all specimens
- Some have a tooth-like structure - tooth and hole arrangement? like [[Mollusca]]?
- No articulation - loss of apical boss is a taphonomic feature
- Opening at the top starts looking like a [[Peduncle]] (maybe [[Pedicle]]?)
	- Grooves look like mantle grooves in modern [[Brachiopoda]]
	- Grooves - where [[Setae]] are extended
- Burgess specimen has a fibrous stalk
- Silica is replicatd the secondary shell structure - same as in [[Brachiopoda]]
- Tiny openings between the fibres
- [[Penetrative Setal Canal]]s?
- Size: 20-30 microns, same size as in [[Brachiopoda]]
- Suspect it had a [[Lophophore]]
- Water flow is reversed copared to modern [[Brachiopoda]]
	- Not too surprising - small and young [[Brachiopoda]] also display this reversal of water flow
- Not quite a [[Brachiopoda]] - maybe a stem-group [[Brachiopoda]]?
- 2 hypothesis: "Fold" and "Tube" hypotheses
- Fold:
	- Scutes from a slug-like ancestor with scutes at the front and the back 'folded' together to create the shell
	- Halkieria
	- Some criticisms
- Tube
	- Scutes from a slug-like ancestor found fused together into a tube
	- Honeycomb structure identical to that of the earliest [[Brachiopoda]]
	- Reduce the number of plates to 2 -> [[Brachiopoda]]?
	- Probably the more likely hypothesis
- Reduction is possible through [[Pedomorphosis]]
- Expands known disparty of pan-brachiopoda
- Disparity: range of body plans
- Diversity: number of species
- What is a [[Phylum]]?
	- between kingdom and class
- Why this pattern of diversity / disparity?
- Maybe there was a "wide-open market"
- Depositional environment?
	- Shap distinction between the [[Shale]] and the [[Dolomite]]
	- Interpreted as a sharp undersea cliff (dolomite) and then the [[Shale]] built up from there
	- Possible that they were shallow (living on top of the cliff) and were then transported to the bottom (washed off)
- [[Carbonate]] aprons - wedge-shaped bits of [[Carbonate]]
	- May be washed from the top of the cliff?
- Why are the [[Stenothecoida]] absent in the shales bt present in the [[Carbonate]]s?
- Indicating little or no transport fro the top of the platform
- Indicates that the [[Burgess Shale]] ?????????

### 3.2 Q / A
- 3 locations that produce [[Stenothecoida]]
	- Only one specimen was articulated
- At another location almost all were articulated
- At the earlier location, probably more active transport -> not articulated
- What is holding them together?
	- No muscle scars
- Uncertain why they went extinct
- The other localities are different from the [[Burgess Shale]] one
- All are tropical
- No other clear similarities
