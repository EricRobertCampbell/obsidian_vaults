- Vertebrates - animals with a backbone
- Vertebrates are members of a larger group - the [[Chordata|chordates]]
	- Don't have a skeleton, but have a [[Notochord]]  - flexible, tough rod that runs the length of the body down the back
	- In living chordates: generally made from [[Collagen]]
	- Invertebrate chordates also generally have V-shaped muscle blocks ([[Myomeres]]) along the length of their body)
- Tree of life: fundamental splits are between [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukaryota]]
	- Plants and animals are members of [[Eukaryota]]
- [[Eukaryota]] are diagnosed by complex celss with membrane-bound nucleus and primitive presence of [[Mitochondria]]
- [[Vertebrata|Vertebrates]] are assumed to be closely related to [[Hemichordata]] and [[Echinodermata]]

## Sea Squirts and the Lancet

- Two key groups of non-vertebrate chodates:
	- Sea Squirts
	- Amphioxus ([[Cephalochordata]])

### Urochordata: Sea Squirts
- Typical sea squirt is [[Ciona]]
- 100-150mm organism shaped like a bag
- translucent outer layer ('tunic') and two openings ('siphons') at the top
- Body is firmly attached to a hard substrate
- Internal structure is fairly complex
	- Large [[Pharynx]] fills most of the internal space
		- Its walls have hundrends of gill slits, each bearing [[Cilia]].
		- Seawater is pumped through the inhalant siphon into the [[Pharynx]] by beating movements of the [[Cilia]]
		- Then passed through the surrounding cavity (Atrium) and ejected through the exhalant siphon
	- [[Pharynx]] serves mainly to capture food particles
	- Seawater is drawn into a filter bag of mucus, the [[Endostyle]]
	- During feeding, the [[Endostyle]] continously secretes mucus into the [[Oesophagus]], along with the food particles it has trapped
	- [[Tunicates]] also have a heart that pumps blood around the body
		- Every few minutes the heart stops beating and the flow of blood reverses
- Why is [[Ciona]] identified as a [[Chordata|chordate]]?
	- [[Pharynx]] and other structures are similar to those of [[Cephalochordata]] and lamprey larva
	- Further evidence is found in the larval stages
		- Free-swimming, vaguely fish-like (or tadpole-shaped)
		- Has a head and a tail
		- Also a [[Notochord]]
		- Muscles on either side of the [[Notochord]] which contract alternately $\to$ side-to-side swimming motion
		- Nerve chord running along the tail, just above the notochord
			- Expands at the front into a simple 'brain', including a light sensor ('eye') and a tilt detector
		- Then the lava settles onto a surface and loses most of this

### [[Cephalochordata]]: Amphioxus
- Another [[Chordata|chordate]] assumed to be close to the [[Vertebrata|vertebrates]] is the [[Amphioxus]] [[Branchiostomata]]
- Adult is quite chordate-like
- 50mm long, paperknife-shaped animal (looks like a lamprey / eel)
- Lacks a head!
- Swims freely by undulating its whole body from side to side
- Burrows in the sea floor
- Feeds by filtering particles out of the seawater
- Water is pumped into the mouth and through the [[Pharynx]] by cilia or gill slits, and food is caught by the bag of mucus produced by the [[Endostyle]] (basically the same system as in the tunicates)
- Mucus containing food is passed into the digestive system, while seawater passes through the gill slits into the atrium
- [[Oxygen]] is also extracted there
- Waste water exits through the [[Atriophore]]
- Anatomy of [[Amphioxus]]: [[Pharynx]], [[Notochord]], dorsal nerve cord, [[Myotomes]], and [[Endostyle]] are typically chordate
- Swimming and burrowing are by means of lateral contractions of the [[Myomeres]] against the stiff, rod-like [[Notochord]]

## Ambulacraria: Echinoderms and Hemichordates
- Close relatives of the [[Chordata]] are the [[Ambulacraria]]: clade consisting of the [[Echinodermata]] and [[Hemichordata]]
- [[Echinodermata]]
	- Starfish, sea urchins, [[Ophiuroids]] (brittle stars), [[Crinoids]] (sea lilies), and [[Holothurians]] (sea cucumbers)
	- All share four key features:
		1. [[Calcite]] skeleton made from many ossicles, each composed of many aligned small crystals ina a somewhat spongy arrangement called *stereom*
		2. A water vascular system that functions in locomotion, respiration, and feeding
		3. Ossicles are linked by mutable collagen, ligaments that are normally rigid but can be loosened
		4. Pentaradial (5-fold) symmetry
- Most features do not show close similarities to other [[Deuterostomia]], but the water vascular system may have evolved from simple tentacular systems (like those of [[Pterobranch]] [[Hemichordata]])
- [[Hemichordata]]:
	- Includes two very different kinds of marine animal
	1. The [[Pterobranch]] (e.g. *Cephalodiscus*): small animals that live in loose olonies on the seabed int he southern hemisphere.
		- *Cephalodiscus* has a plate-like head shield, a collar with 5- 9 pairs of feeding arms, and a sack-like trunk perforated by a pair of hill slits and containing the guts and gonads
		- Cilia on the arms produce a feeding current, and food particles are captured by mucus on the arms
		- Water passes out of the [[Pharynx]] through the [[Gill Slits]]
		- Live in or around a group of horny tubes that the colony has constructed
		- Attaches itself inside the tubes by means of a sucker on the end of a stalk
	2. Acorn worms ([[Enteropneusts]])
		- e.g. *Saccoglossus*
		- worm-like animals from 20mm - 2.5m
		- Live in buttows on the the shore in [[Europe]] and elsewhere
		- *Saccoglossus*
			- Long, muscular proboscis that fits into the fleshy ring / collar behind
			- Mouth is placed beneath the collar
			- Seawater and sand pumped through the gyt and expelled through an anus at the posterior end of the animal
			- Long body is pierced by small holes at the front end, homologous with the gill slits of *Cephalodiscus*, sea squirts, amphioxus, and vertebrates
			- Developmental genes also indicate that the postanal tail is homologous to that in vertebrates
		- Fossil record has been debated
		- Assumed that the extinct, colonial [[Graptolites]] were a clade of [[Hemichordata]] (and allied with [[Pterobranch]]) based on similarities in the ultrastructure of the wall structures
			- However, new discoveries from the [[Burgess Shale]] may be shifting the needle to having the [[Graptolites]] more closely allied to the [[Enteropneusts]]
- Phylogeny of [[Hemichordata]] is hotly debated
- Lots of evidence that it is a valid phylum
- Do not have a [[Notochord]], bu they possess [[Gill Slits]] and giant nerve cells in the nerve cord of the collar region that are probably equivalent to those in primitive vertebrates
- [[Pterobranch]] and [[Enteropneusts]] share features indicating their monophyly:
	- Stomochord (anterior buccal tube on the dorsal part of the [[Pharynx]])
	- Mesocoelomic ducts
## Deuterostome Relationships
- Intensive use of molecular data has provided a clearer picture of chordate relationships
- [[Chordata]] is part of a larger clade:
	- [[Deuterostomia]]: [[Chordata]], [[Hemichordata]], and [[Echinodermata]]
		- In turn part of the larger clade, the [[Bilateria]] (all bilaterally symmetric animals)
			- Itself part of [[Metazoa]], the animals
   
### Embryology and the position of the anus
- In early development, an animal is a single cell
- Divides and divides, until it becomes a hollow ball of cells: the [[Blastula]]
- A pocket of cells then moves inwards, forming the precursor of the gut and other internal structures
- The opening of this deep pocket is called the [[Blastopore]]
- Imagine pushing in a rubber squash ball: [[Gastrula]] stage
- Animals tend to fall into two groups, based on the relative orientation of the mouth and anus
	- In most invertebrates ([[Protostomia]]), the blastopore becomes the mouth and a secondary anus develops later
	- In others (the [[Deuterostomia]]), the blastopore becomes the anus and a secondary mouth develops later
- This switch seems pretty incredible
- NB Many [[Protostomia]] show deuterostomy, and this condition may be primitive

### Animal phylogenetics
- Animals ([[Metazoa]]) are distinguished by a combination of
	- feeding
		- Heterotrophic - feed on other organisms to get carbon
	- being motile
		- Use energy to move spontaneously and actively
	- lacking rigid cell walls
	- passing through the [[Blastula]] stage
- Not all exclusive
- [[Metazoa]], [[Bilateria]], and [[Deuterostomia]] are monophyletic groups (clades)
	- Consist of an ancestor and all its descendants
- Fundamental division of [[Metazoa]] into six early-branching clades
- [[Bilateria]] have bilateral symmetry primitively, and most are *triploblastic* - three fundamental body wall tissues that arise from the *ectoderm*, *mesoderm*, and *endoderm* in the embryo
- Non-[[Bilateria]] metazoans may be *diploblastic*, lacking the mesoderm, or monoblastic (like sponges)
- Within [[Bilateria]], most animals are [[Nephrozoa]], (characterized by an excretory system)
	- The two major clades of [[Nephrozoa]] are the [[Protostomia]] and [[Deuterostomia]]
- [[Protostomia]]
	- [[Ecdysozoa]] - animals that moult, like nematodes, [[Arthropoda]], priapulids
	- [[Spiralia]] - animals with spiral development, such as [[Bryozoans]], annelids, [[Mollusca]], [[Brachiopoda]], rotifers, and others
		- Most belong to the clade [[Lophotrochozoa]]
- [[Deuterostomia]]
	- Share a posterior blastopore that becomes the anus
	- Gill slits

## Chordate origins
- [[Chordata]] all share unique characters:
	- [[Notochord]]
	- [[Endostyle]] - equivalent to the thyroid gland in vertebrates
	- Post-anal tail used for swimming
- Many putative early [[Chordata]] fossils
	- Numbers have grown remarkably with the discovery of the [[Chengjiang Biota]], and early [[Cambrian]] lagerstatte from [[China]]

### Diverse early chordates
- Three main categories of possible early [[Chordata]]:
	- urochordates
	- cephalochordates
	- vetulicolians
- At one time it was thought that [[Conodonta]] might have been but they're placed firmly within the [[Vertebrata]] as jawless fishes
- Urochordates:
	- spotty fossil record
	- trace fossils
	- Best fossils are sac-like animals from the [[Chengjiang Biota]] *Shankouclava*
		- Shows a large, perforated branchial basket
		- Branckial slits
		- Elongate endostyle
		- Possibly a degenerate tail?
- Cephalochordates
	- Also spotty fossil record
	- [[Chengjiang Biota]] includes an amphioxus-like *Cathaymyrus*, along with the *yunnanozoons* (although most actually assign these elsewhere among [[Deuterostomia]])
- In the absence of hard parts (bone), it  can be very difficult to classify these

### Vetulicolians and yunnanozoons
- [[Vetulicolia]] - unusual group based on about ten species from the [[Chengjiang Biota]]
	- Also: [[Banffia]], from the [[Burgess Shale]]
	- Look like sausage balloons, knotted in the middle of the body but bulbous sections before and behind
	- Large mouth with a strenthened rim
	- preserved internal structures include guts
	- Both parts oft the body appear to be crossed by transverse bands
	- On the mouth-bearing segment, there are 5 circular structures that have been interpreted as pharyngeal gill slits
- First regarded as unusual [[Arthropoda]], then as [[Deuterostomia]]
- [[Yunnanozoons]], also from the [[Chengjiang Biota]], are much more convincing as basal [[Chordata]]
	- [[Yunnanozoons]]
	- [[Haikouella]]
	- Fish-like form
	- dorsal fin
	- postanal tail
	- notochord
	- gill slits
	- Some head structures
	- Still some controversy as to what / where they actually live in the phylogeny
- [[Pikaia gracilens]]
	- Widely regarded as an early chordate (or maybe even vertebrate)
	- Laterally compressed body with about 100 myomeres
	- Thin dorsal fin
	- small bilobed head with tentacle (no eyes)
	- Possly pharyngeal pos
	- Pharyngeal cavity
	- Almost terminal mouth
	- Possible terminal anus (no postanal tail)
	- Dorsal nerve cord
	- Possible notochord
	- Blood vascular system
	- Determining the position is problematic
- One further complication: **rotting bias**
	- Some experiments have shown that as organisms decay, the "primitive" features tend to preserve and the more derived characters are the first to be lost
	- "Stemward slippage" of preserved organisms

### Development and vertebrate origins
- Development indicates a lot about their ancestry
- Studies of the genome allow developmental biologists to relate specific anatomical structures to genes
- Allow hypotheses of homology to be tested
- Studies like these shed light on the hypothesis that vertebrates arose from sea squirt tadpole
	- Proposed that transitory characters like e.g. the tail were fixed through [[Pedomorphosis]]
	- However, this theory is rejected by recent molecular phylogenies of tunicates

## Vertebrates and the Head
- All vertebrates have specialized head features (the cranium / skull)
- Additional synapomorphies of vertebrates:
	- well-defined sensory organs w/ appopriate nerve connections
	- Cranial nerves
	- Olfactory, optic, and auditory (otic) regions that make up a true brain
