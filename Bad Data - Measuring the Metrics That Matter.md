# Bad Data - Measuring the Metrics That Matter
- Talk presented by [[Data For Good]]
- Speaker: [[Peter Schryvers]]

- Based on the book of the same name
- Focus on the wrong things because we measure the wrong things
- Related to the [[Drunk Under the Streetlamp]] story
- Cobra Effect - [[Goodhart's Law]]
- "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
-  Metric: a measurement / data with a goal and incentives
- Paradox of metrics - using metrics often results in counter-productive behaviour
- Two ways to game metrics:
	1. Manipulate the data
	2. Alter behaviour to focus solely on the metric
- Education - Standardized Test Score and High-Pressure Test Environments
	- Atlanta Public Scools, 1999-2009
	- High pressure to achieve results
	- Rolling standards: each year the standards increased by 3%
	- Punishment for not meeting it, significant incentives for meeting them
	- Successful - test scores improved across the state (Language Arts: 50% meetings the minimum -> 90%)
	- Classic example of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) driving behaviour:
		1. Determine the KPIs
		2. Set the standards
		3. Reward for meeting, punish for not
		4. KPIs improve
		5. Celebrate!
	- Some funny business - incredible improvement on re-writes of tests, students with high tests scores were coming to junior high barely able to read, &c.
	- Turns out: widespread cheating (83% of schools were cheating)
	- 178 teachers and principals were criminally charged
	- Why?
		- If they didn't cheat, they would lose their jobs!
		- Standards were impossible, especially because others were cheating
- Corporate short-termism: e.g. cut the marketing department because it improves the bottom line in the short term and the bad effects aren't felt until later
- Police, CompStat, and crime statistics - pressure to make the crime numbers go down. Predictably, this resulted in some dodgy behaviour (misreporting, fraud, "downgrading" crimes to misdemeanours, &c.)
- Lessons:
	- Avoid using metrics as incentives. Instead use them as program evaluations. Incentives lead to metric manipulation
	- If possible, those being incentivized should bot be responsible or have access to metric recording
	- Focus on long-term, outcome-based metrics. Short term activity-based metrics lead to short term behaviour
	- Use a variety of metrics to ensure no single metric is being prioritized over others
